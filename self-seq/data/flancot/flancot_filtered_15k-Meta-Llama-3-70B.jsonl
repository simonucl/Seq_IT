Let's think step by step. The original instruction asks how to accomplish a goal, but it doesn't specify preparing for the task or considering necessary tools or methods. By adding a prefix task, you can enhance the clarity and feasibility of achieving the goal.\n#New Instruction#: “Assess available objects or tools that can be used to depress a keyboard note, and determine how to use the selected object or tool to hold down a keyboard note without using your hands.”###\n\n#Original Instruction#: 'Generate a movie review with positive sentiment.'\nNow adding a prefix task. Let's think step by step. The instruction already directs to produce a specific type of content, namely a movie review that has a positive tone. However, it lacks a step that involves evaluating or considering specific elements of the movie which could be highlighted in the review to reinforce the positive sentiment. Adding a prefix task would provide a clearer framework for constructing a positive review by focusing on specific positive aspects of the movie.\n#New Instruction#: “Evaluate the key positive elements of the movie, such as acting, direction, storyline, and cinematography, and based on these elements, generate a movie review with positive sentiment.”###\n\n#Original Instruction#: 'How is \"Are you looking for a fun but serious teacher?...\" said in Russian?'\nNow adding a prefix task.

      "2. Prioritize Tasks: Identify the most important tasks and deadlines, then prioritize them accordingly. By focusing on essential activities first, students can reduce stress and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n",
      "3. Seek Support: Reach out to teachers, parents, or school counselors for support and guidance. Having a support system in place can provide valuable advice and assistance in managing schoolwork and extracurricular activities.\n",
      "4. Practice Self-Care: Take breaks when needed, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being. Avoiding burnout is crucial for maintaining a healthy balance between school and extracurricular commitments.\n",

      "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's extensive standard library provides built-in modules and functions for various tasks, making it versatile and efficient. Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing due to its ease of use and powerful capabilities.\n",

      "Python syntax is characterized by its readability and simplicity, making it an ideal language for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Some key syntax features of Python include:\n",
      "1. Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, eliminating the need for curly braces or semicolons.\n",
      "2. Variables: Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type explicitly.\n",
      "3. Comments: Comments in Python start with the '#' symbol and are used to explain code or make notes.\n",
      "4. Data Types: Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
      "5. Control Structures: Python uses if-else statements, loops (for and while), and functions to control the flow of the program.\n",
      "6. Functions: Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword and can return values using the 'return' statement.\n",
      "7. Modules: Python modules are files containing Python code that can be imported into other Python programs using the 'import' statement.\n",
      "8. Object-Oriented Programming: Python supports classes and objects, allowing for the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts.\n",

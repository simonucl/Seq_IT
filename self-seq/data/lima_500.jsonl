{"conversations":["Most of the books I read give examples using <code>printf<\/code> and <code>scanf<\/code>. At some point the students know perfectly how to use these two functions but they don't know about <code>stdin<\/code>, <code>stdout<\/code> and <code>argv<\/code>. \nTo me and according to many programming principles (e.g. KISS) a program should not interrupt the execution for prompting the user. Instead, and this is a much clever approach, the developer should learn to use the power of pipes and use the options and the arguments. \nI think this:\n<code>$ whatdaywas 1982 02 16\nMonday\n<\/code>\nIs much better than: \n<code>$ whatdaywas\nEnter a year: 1982\nEnter a month: 2\nEnter a day: 16\nIt was a Monday.\n<\/code>\nIs there any rationale behind this pedagogical approach?","When tutoring young CS students, user input is actually a tricky concept. If it were not for user input, the results of any program could be pre-compiled into nothing but its output. You get one lesson from getting all the input right at the beginning, with argc\/argv, but from that point on, its just the computer churning. You get a different lesson from getting input during the execution of the program.\n\nThe idea of getting input from the user is surprisingly non-intuitive, given that nearly every program we interact with on a daily basis does it. This suggests that introducing it early helps prune misconceptions about how computers work before they become a real problem.\n\nObviously not every student is the same, but a particular pattern is that they can understand what a program should do when it executes but not how that actually happens. They can look at\n<code>BOOL x = TRUE;\nif (x)\n    printf(\"Hello\\n\");\nelse\n    printf(\"World\\n\");\n<\/code>\nAnd they can intuit that the program should print \"Hello\", but they can't intuit how a computer can possibly do so. Students are often told to figure the compiler does the \"magic,\" and figure out which printf to use (let's ignore optimizers for a moment).\nHowever, when the values come from input, you can no longer think about the computer as a magic device which reaches the final result immediately. You have to see that it is following steps. We know this, but it seems many students don't grasp this at first.\nIf you have inputs coming from `argv`, its easier to keep this illusion going. If you have input during the program, after the program has already done something, you have to realize what's going on quicker.  In particular, it gets you closer to the point of realizing that the input the computer asks for may vary based on previous inputs (press 1 to calculate the area of a circle, press 2 to calculate the area of a rectangle.  Depending on the next scanf\/gets, the computer will ask for one additional number or two).","Could you elaborate on the unintuitive bit?  I'm always on the lookout for new cognitive traps that I haven't noticed before.","It's found that some students learn the concept of functions before they grasp the idea of execution. They can wade their way through the code and make sense of it in their head, but they can't see that the computer wades through it also, in real time. Interestingly, the same people tend to assume that if they compile `if(x) f(); else g();`, that the compiler figures out which of those two branches will be taken, and only captures the instructions for that branch. They get bothered if the teacher constructs examples where it's hard to know which branch will be taken (such as when there is input)."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1000}
{"conversations":["How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?","Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what\u2019s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don\u2019t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren\u2019t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you\u2019ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, \u201cSpending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.\u201d\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don\u2019t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, \u201cI can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.\u201d\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you\u2019re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don\u2019t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won\u2019t work. This may include what you will and won\u2019t do when you\u2019re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, \u201cI have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.\u201d\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don\u2019t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn\u2019t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, \u201cI do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.\u201d\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren\u2019t working, tell yourself, \u201cNothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.\u201d\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don\u2019t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don\u2019t overextend yourself.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":747}

{"conversations":["How to physically flirt with a girl?","Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table\/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don\u2019t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":603}
{"conversations":["What's the difference between ASCII and Unicode?","ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127.  It can fit in a single 8-bit byte, the values 128 through 255 tended to be used for other characters. With incompatible choices, causing the code page disaster.  Text encoded in one code page cannot be read correctly by a program that assumes or guessed at another code page.\n\nUnicode came about to solve this disaster. Version 1 started out with 65536 code points, commonly encoded in 16 bits. Later extended in version 2 to 1.1 million code points. The current version is 6.3, using 110,187 of the available 1.1 million code points. That doesn't fit in 16 bits anymore.\nEncoding in 16-bits was common when v2 came around, used by Microsoft and Apple operating systems for example. And language runtimes like Java. The v2 spec came up with a way to map those 1.1 million code points into 16-bits. An encoding called UTF-16, a variable length encoding where one code point can take either 2 or 4 bytes.  The original v1 code points take 2 bytes, added ones take 4.  \n\nAnother variable length encoding that's very common, used in *nix operating systems and tools is UTF-8, a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, the original ASCII codes take 1 byte the rest take more.  The only non-variable length encoding is UTF-32, takes 4 bytes for a code point. Not often used since it is pretty wasteful. There are other ones, like UTF-1 and UTF-7, widely ignored.\nAn issue with the UTF-16\/32 encodings is that the order of the bytes will depend on the endian-ness of the machine that created the text stream. So add to the mix UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.\n\nHaving these different encoding choices brings back the code page disaster to some degree, along with heated debates among programmers which UTF choice is \"best\". Their association with operating system defaults pretty much draws the lines. One counter-measure is the definition of a BOM, the Byte Order Mark, a special codepoint (U+FEFF, zero width space) at the beginning of a text stream that indicates how the rest of the stream is encoded. It indicates both the UTF encoding and the endianess and is neutral to a text rendering engine. Unfortunately it is optional and many programmers claim their right to omit it so accidents are still pretty common."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":120}

{"conversations":["How to recognize fundamentalist thinking?","Fundamentalism is a concept that often, historically, had religious connotations. However, it's a common term that describes a way of expressing ideals and related activities to express (from the point of view of the speaker) a perceived, accurate, ideological focus. Here are some common factors among those referred to as fundamentalists.\n\n## Step\n\n1. Understand the definition: Identifying persons who hold a \"strict adherence to the fundamental principles of any set of beliefs\" -- as viewed by another individual. The use of the word \"fundamentalist\" is often intended to denote a certain point of view, but \"fundamentalist\" may be used in a negative connotation, being pejorative (derisive) of particular scientific, political or religious concepts.\n2. Understand that seeking to recognize fundamentalism may be educational and informative. This is not to indicate that fundamentalism is \"on-\/off-beat\", centered versus eccentric (different) or \"good\" versus \"bad\".\n3. Do not equate \"fundamentalism\" with being \"religious\". As, some of the unflattering literature on fundamentalism was written by people who consider themselves quite religious but who have differing doctrines and understandings. Confusing or mixing the two concepts will lead to misconceptions in identifying fundamentalist expression and activity (behavior). Judging the fundamentalist harshly could lead to social stigma, discrimination, prejudice, bias and possibly hatred.\n4. Appreciate the differences among varied types of fundamentalists. The term has been historically used to describe various, diverse groups, religious movements, political movements and philosophical or scientific schools of thought. The term itself has several definitions in use and meaning.\n5. Seek a common set of behaviors and indicators that are dominant\/common in the different uses according to a particular definition.\n\n\n## Indications by usage\n\n1. Use the word responsibly to credit and acknowledge a defined set of concepts, or beliefs or their advocates. Following is a list of some of the different uses of the term throughout history:\n\t* Religious Fundamentalism:\n\t* Fundamentalist Christianity recognizes an adherence to a basic set of Biblical, fundamental principles to preserve unity and harmony among believers. These fundamentals include a literal interpretation of the Bible as the divinely inspired and infallible Word of God and the necessity of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Some consider Christian fundamentalism to be identical with evangelicalism. Jesus said -- \"...go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (Matthew 28:19,20 NIV). While Christian fundamentalists hold unswervingly to their basic tenets, they encourage open-minded study of the Bible, intellectual discussion of \"true\" (Biblical) versus \"false\" (non-Biblical) doctrines and whether some traditional practices are\/are-not Biblical. Islamic Fundamentalism: This includes advocating return to the \"fundamentals\" of Islam: The Quran and The Sunnah. Definitions vary as some insist that Islamic belief requires all Muslims be fundamentalists and is, also, a term used by outsiders to describe perceived trends within Islam; whereas, some figures of Islamic fundamentalism may be termed \"Islamists\". Some say that \"Radical Islam\" is the term for movements beginning in the 1920s -- and that, some say, is not a return to the more historic fundamentals. Jewish Fundamentalism\n\t* Mormon Fundamentalism\n\t* Hindu Fundamentalism\n\t* Atheistic Fundamentalists. - Observe atheistic fundamentalism as whether there is a strong disdain toward those who espouse religion, and some would say, a dogmatic opposition to what appears to be religious tradition. Some atheist thinkers, such as Richard Dawkins, argue that no such fundamentalism exists, and that the term is meant to be disparaging of atheists' concepts. Non-religious Fundamentalism:\n\t* Political Conservatism (Fundamentalism) including being \"strict constructionist\", being a \"constitutional originalist\" to follow the traditional meaning of the constitution and the basic law, not some modern, re-formed meaning. Scientism (Fundamentalism). - Consider that beginning in the nineteenth century, some scientists stated scientism as the view that all aspects of the universe are knowable through the methods of the scientist and that advances in all forms of knowledge could be made through scientific progress; whereas, philosophy had historically relied on intuition and other modes of thought as the source of knowledge and as equal or preferred to empirical investigation.\n\t* \n\t* Market Fundamentalism. - check to verify whether there is a strong belief in laissez-faire, free-market systems of financial regulation. The recession was not due to regulation, but to schemes including an over-trusted kind of certificate called the \"Collateralized debt obligation\"; this is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS) whose value and payments are supposed to be derived from a portfolio of fixed-income underlying assets (but many were like bad mutual-fund shares). CDOs securities are split into different risk classes, but many bad \"CDOs\" were over-rated conglomerations of some good preferred stocks, bonds and too much of over-valued bad mortgages as some trillions of dollars of poor \"investments\" sold around the world -- and the related, bad-mortgages were a major cause of the banking crisis, also devastating to the economy. Some left-economists declared that the global financial crisis, so caused, of 2008 destroyed market fundamentalist's ideas of free markets. This expression, \"market fundamentalism,\" was promulgated by George Soros in his 1998 book, The Crisis of Global Capitalism. As is \"atheistic fundamentalism\", \"market fundamentalism\" is often used as a pejorative to designate perceived, ideological dogma with which one may disagree.\n2. Be as objective as possible realizing indicators depend upon ones point of view -- or, perhaps, bias. Do not go looking for \"signs\" in persons to prove they are indeed fundamentalists after you question their being so. Instead, only use this as a reference. In other words -- if, by chance, unintentionally, you encounter some of the indicators in a person's expressed views, look for the other indications very closely, trying to prove that they are not there! If you fail to eliminate them, you can relatively well identify the person as fundamentalist.\n3. Be sure that the indicators listed under \"Common Indications\" apply before going any further.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":795}

{"conversations":["I am [Student], a master of CMU with a double degree in civil engineering and computer science. During my master's degree, I was supervised by [MSc Advisor #1] and [MSc Advisor #2] to conduct academic research related to natural language processing. I am preparing for the Ph.D program this fall (2023). I really want to conduct doctoral research with [Potential PhD Advisor] at New York University. Can you help me write a powerful statement of purpose? Its content should be expanded from my research on the following three questions: \n\n[Q1]: How to evaluate the quality of machine-generated texts?\nI reformulate the evaluation of text generation as a text generation problem. My first work got accepted to NeurIPS. I was invited by [Esteemed Professor] to give a talk.\n[Q2]: Can machines help with scientific peer review? \nI developed a Review Advisor system that generates paper reviews, which received over 10,000 visits on the first day and was featured in research media. We also write a technical report of over 25 pages.\n[Q3]: Can machines better communicate with humans?\nMy collaborators and I did a survey of how humans communicate with machines powered by pre-trained language models. Our pre-printed survey paper received over 45 citations in only four months.","Sure, here is a statement of purpose draft based on your information.\n\n# Statement of Purpose of [Student] (CS Ph.D applicant for Fall 2023)\n\n\u201cA computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human\u201d - Alan Turing. Although I chose civil engineering as my major during my undergraduate years, I was amazed by the idea that \u201cmachines can think\u201d when I took an elective course named \u201cIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u201d in my freshman year. Especially at that time, an AI program AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the world champion of Go. In this context, I was eager to learn about AI and resolved to make computer science my second major. Although I had to take a lot more classes and bear with doubled learning pressures compared with ordinary students, I still ranked [Academic Rank] in my major. My hard work and diverse interdisciplinary background got me accepted to CMU\u2019s master\u2019s program to better pursue the field of AI.\n\nCMU offers a wide variety of resources for different branches of AI. Among all those options, I developed a great interest in natural language processing (NLP). As Alan Turing once said, an intelligent machine would deceive a human into believing that it was human. Wouldn\u2019t that be a big step towards a truly intelligent machine if a machine could communicate in natural language like a human? With this in mind, I did some preliminary research explorations under the excellent supervision of [MSc Advisor #1] and [MSc Advisor #2].\n\n## Q1: How to evaluate the quality of machine-generated texts?\nEnabling machines to generate natural language is an important and challenging task. Correspondingly, how to assess the quality of text generated by existing machine learning systems is a question worth exploring. Through an extensive literature review, I summarized the limitations of existing state-of-the-art metrics. By making a paradigm shift that formulates the evaluation of text generation as a text generation problem, those limitations are naturally solved. This novel idea was not only recognized by peer review and eventually accepted by NeurIPS at the first submission but also appreciated by [Esteemed Professor], an expert in the field, who invited me to give a talk.\n\n## Q2: Can machines help with scientific peer review?\nThis is the project I am most proud of during my master\u2019s degree. Not only because I spent one year patiently experiencing the complete research cycle from collecting data, training models, analyzing results, deploying online Demo, to writing a technical paper of over 25 pages. But also because it was my first attempt to use AI technology to solve an under-explored problem that desperately needed a solution. Our Review Advisor system received over 10,000 visits on the first day of opening and was featured in popular research media. While the reviews generated by our system lack details, they certainly can help reviewers frame their reviews. I used to think that we were striving for machines to take over human jobs. But now I see that perhaps what we need is not machines that replace humans, but machines that assist humans. If machines can communicate with humans using natural language, they can better assist humans in doing various tasks. This made me reflect on the way humans and machines communicate with each other.\n\n## Q3: Can machines better communicate with humans?\n To answer this question, my collaborators and I reviewed over two hundred relevant papers and summarized four different paradigms in the development of NLP in terms of the way humans communicate with machines (i.e., instantiated by pre-trained language models). We released a survey paper to elaborate on each paradigm, and our pre-printed paper has gained over 45 citations in only four months.\nBy summarizing different communication paradigms, I have gained new thoughts about the future development of NLP. Recently, people began to reformulate various NLP tasks into the language modeling task to communicate with models in natural language. But how to improve the models\u2019 memorization and generalization ability under this paradigm remains under-explored. This is one of the directions I would like to explore in the future.\n\nDuring my master\u2019s degree, extensive AI-related courses enriched my theoretical knowledge and opened my eyes to the landscapes of various fields, while several independent research experiences cultivated my practical skills and improved my research taste. All the previous accumulations have prepared me to continue my research in the field of NLP. With the beautiful willingness to drive this field forward, I am here applying for the CS PhD program at NYU. I\u2019m eager to join the [Lab Name] at NYU and work with the amazing researchers in NLP. I am particularly drawn to NYU because some of the professors there are researching topics that align with my current interests, specifically [Potential PhD Advisor]. I look forward to conducting research under the guidance of faculty unrivaled in this domain and working with brilliant peers. After obtaining a Ph.D. degree, I plan to look for a faculty position in academia and continue doing research.\n\n\nGood luck on your application!"],"source":"authors","idx":524}

{"conversations":["What does it mean for an album to be remastered?","Mastering is a separate art from recording or mixing. According to the Wikipedia article, the principle processes of mastering are:\n\n* Editing minor flaws.\n* Applying noise reduction to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss.\n* Adjusting stereo width.\n* Adding ambience.\n* Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution.\n* Adjust volume.\n* Dynamic range compression or expansion.\n* Peak limit.\n* Dither.\n\nThe common thread between these processes is that they can be performed on the complete mixed recording, not just on individual tracks of a recording. Because of this, mastering can be performed at any time on any audio source.\nAs for the reason why so many works are remastered, the most likely reason is to keep up with new home theater audio formats. If you have a massive 7.2 surround system, it would be a shame if there wasn't a professionally mastered 7.2 format of \"Dark Side of the Moon\" to utilize that power.

The lights are usually adjusted at dusk, night or dawn to match the exterior environment.\n\nIf the cabin lights do not fail during an emergency, the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the \"EXIT\" signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow. The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed, saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated.\n\nThis also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows. The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation, however, with a darker cabin, any outside light source, especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew, making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster, e.g. fire on port side --> no evacuation on that side.\n\nThe blinds are therefore raised to allow a better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts, such as engines, wings, etc."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":257}
{"conversations":["How to make a model water tower?","Water towers are large, elevated tanks of water that are essential for the distribution of clean water to many communities across the globe. Not only do they come in many different shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s intriguing to learn about the way water towers work. Whether you need a model water tower for a train set or school project, or you simply want to learn about the way they work, you can easily build your own model with the right materials and know-how.\n\n## Create a function model water tower\n\n1. Locate a small plastic bottle and a large plastic bottle. The small water bottle can be a standard-sized Coke, juice, or water bottle, as long as it has a screw-on cap. The large bottle should be a 2-liter soda bottle, jug, or a large juice bottle. Test the size of your bottles by placing the small bottle upside-down, with its neck sticking into the opening on the large bottle. The small bottle should sit comfortably on top of the large one. If it does not, you will need to find different bottles. The bottles must be plastic, as you will need to cut them.\n2. Remove the cap from the small bottle and cut a hole in the middle of it. Use scissors to punch a hole into the center of the cap, then widen the hole until it\u2019s slightly smaller than the circumference of the holes at both ends of the tubing. Water will leak out of the hole if it\u2019s too big, but it will still need to be big enough to push the tubing into it. It\u2019s better to have a hole that\u2019s too small than a hole that\u2019s too big, as you can always use your scissors to widen it if necessary.\n3. Punch a pin-sized hole in the bottom of the small water bottle. Use a pin, needle, earring, or any other device that will create an almost invisible hole. This will allow the bottle to vent when the water starts flowing.\n4. Cut a medium-sized hole in the side of the large bottle. Make the hole big enough that the cap and tubing can both fit through it. You can put the hole anywhere on the bottle that you choose, but roughly halfway down the bottle is a good option. Unlike the small bottle, you don\u2019t have to worry about leaks if this hole isn\u2019t the right size. This hole can be large or small just as long as the cap and tubing will fit through it comfortably.\n5. Feed 1 end of the tubing through the hole in the large bottle. Push the tubing through the large hole and out through the top of the large bottle. Lay the large bottle on its side with the hole you cut facing upward for easier access.\n6. Squeeze the same end of the tubing into the hole you cut in the cap. Feed roughly 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of tubing in through the cap. Clamp the binder clip roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the other side of the tubing. Put the side of the tubing with the binder clip into a bowl that will catch the water. If your hole on the cap is the right size, you will have to forcefully push the tubing into the hole. It should fit snugly in the hole without slipping.\n7. Fill the small bottle with water. Once the bottle is full, place the cap with the tubing through it on top of the bottle. Feed the tubing into the water, then screw the cap on tightly. Hold your finger over the pin-sized hole on the bottom of the bottle to keep water from leaking out.\n8. Place the small bottle upside-down in the top opening on the large bottle. The neck of the small bottle should fit all the way into the opening on the large bottle. You now have a functioning model water tower! The water should flow into the tubing once you flip it upside down, but the binder clip will stop the flow. Experiment by releasing the clip at different heights to see where the water stops flowing.\n\n\n## Build a model water tower with popsicle stick\n\n1. Cut the rounded ends off of roughly 70 Popsicle sticks. Barely snip both ends of each Popsicle stick to make the ends straight on both sides. Make them all as close to the same size as possible. To cut the sticks evenly, line up the second stick with the first stick you cut. Use the first Popsicle stick as reference for where to cut the second stick. Do the same thing for the third, the fourth, and so on, until all 70 Popsicle sticks are the same size.\n2. Snip 2 of the cut Popsicle sticks in half. You don\u2019t have to measure them, but cut them as close to the center as possible. You will now have 4 smaller pieces of Popsicle stick that are roughly half the length of the other Popsicle sticks.\n3. Apply glue to 1 end of 1 of the small stick sections. Connect the edge of a second small stick to the area where you just applied glue. Then, apply glue to the end of the second piece that is not connected. Glue the edge of a third small section to the open second section. Repeat this process for the fourth section, then apply glue to connect the edge of the fourth section to the open edge of the first section you glued. You will now have a square frame made out of the 4 smaller Popsicle pieces. Your frame doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly square. In fact, if you\u2019re going for a rustic look, an imperfect square may even be ideal. If you\u2019re using super glue, you can apply glue to all 4 edges before connecting them all together. If you\u2019re using hot glue, make sure to glue each edge separately. This will keep the glue from drying before you can connect all 4 sections together.\n4. Line up 2 larger Popsicle sticks to create 1 long, straight stick. Place the sticks on a flat surface with their ends touching. Take another Popsicle stick of the same size and apply glue to the entire surface on 1 side, lengthwise. Place the glued side directly in the middle of the 2 sticks that are lined up. The third stick does not have to be exactly in the middle of the other 2 sticks, but it should be close enough that it holds the other 2 sticks together evenly.\n5. Repeat this process 3 more times. Follow the same process as before by lining up 2 of the larger Popsicle sticks and gluing a third stick on top of them. Do this 3 more times until you have 4 identical long sections that are each made out of 3 glued Popsicle sticks.\n6. Connect the end of 1 of the long sticks to the inside corner of the square frame. Apply glue to the inside edge of the long stick and place it at a slight outward angle, with the third stick that is holding the other 2 sticks together facing inward. Glue the long stick so that it does not poke out above the frame once connected. Do the same thing with the other 3 long sections you created in the other 3 corners of the frame. This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks. Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees. If the angle is too steep, the water tower will be too short. If it is too steep, it will probably topple over.\n7. Use another Popsicle stick to connect 2 of the legs together. Apply glue to each inside edge of the stick. Place the edges of the Popsicle stick on top of the lines where the 2 Popsicle sticks used to create the legs meet. Do the same thing with 3 other sticks until you have a stick connecting the legs on all 4 sides. You will need to spread the legs apart so that the sticks do not hang outside the edge of the leg. Keep the connecting sticks as level as possible. You want it to appear as if there is a single, continuous stick wrapping around the legs of the tower, not 4 separate small sticks.\n8. Lay 9 Popsicle sticks side-by-side on a flat surface. Line them up along their long edges so the sticks make a square when lined up. Apply a line of glue on the edge of the square down the length of all 9 Popsicle sticks. Place another Popsicle stick along the same direction as the glue line so that it holds all 9 sticks together. Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square. The Popsicle sticks used to hold the other 9 sticks together should be the same length as the square, so that they match up perfectly with both corners and do not hang over the edge. You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths. Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it. Place your hand flat on top of all 9 sticks, and do your best to keep them all together with no gaps between them.\n9. Apply glue to the top edge of the square frame you made earlier. Place the square platform you just created on top of the frame, connecting it to the base structure you already made. Glue the platform so that the Popsicle sticks used to connect the other sticks together are facing downward. You can also glue each individual Popsicle stick directly onto the square frame you made earlier. It will take longer, but you may be able to line the sticks up better this way.\n10. Cut the rim off of a small paper Dixie cup. Cut around the top of the open side to remove the outer rim. Try to keep the line as straight as possible, since this will form the foundation for the water container part of your water tower.\n11. Glue the remaining Popsicle sticks to the outside of the Dixie cup. Place glue along one of the wide edges of a Popsicle stick. Line up the top edge of the stick with the bottom edge of the cup and glue it down. Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the cup until it is completely covered. When gluing the sticks onto the cup, fan them out from one another to create a more realistic look. When you place the second stick on the cup, keep the edge of the stick as close to the edge of the cup as possible, but fan out the end that is jutting over the edge of the cup by about 5 degrees so that a small sliver of the cup can be seen underneath. Roughly half of the length of each Popsicle stick will be glued to the Dixie cup, while the other half will be jutting out over the rim of the cup.\n12. Cover the gaps in the Popsicle sticks by gluing another layer on top. If you fanned out the sticks to create a more realistic look, go back over the cup with additional Popsicle sticks. Glue the sticks directly in the middle of two sticks on the bottom layer so that the second layer covers up any slivers of cup that may be showing. Keep the edges lined up with the bottom edge of the cup as best you can.\n13. Place the Dixie cup in the middle of the platform with the open side up. Apply glue around the entire circumference of the bottom of the cup. Then, stick it down as close to the middle of the platform as possible. Use a lot of glue to attach the Dixie cup so that it doesn\u2019t fall off if it\u2019s bumped. Optionally, you can wrap a string around the bottom and middle of the Dixie cup to give it a Western look. Wrap the string several times for better results.\n14. Use 2 wooden dowels to create a ladder. Place 2 wooden dowels roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a flat surface. Line them up so they are parallel with the pointy side on top. Use small sections of Popsicle sticks roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to create the steps. Apply glue to both ends of 1 side of the stick, then place it horizontally between the dowels so that it connects them together. Do this all the way up the 2 dowels, roughly 7 times, until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointy side of the dowels is left sticking out.\n15. Lean the ladder against the water tower at an angle and secure it with glue. Glue another small section of Popsicle stick horizontally across the very tips of the dowels, above and on the opposite side of the steps. Lean it up against the side of your water tower with the tips facing up. Place glue on the backside of the tips of the dowel and press down to attach it.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":766}
{"conversations":["This claim was made popular by being said in the movie The Social Network. It exactly says:\n\n> Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?\n","This claim can actually be tested very easily. Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1\/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1\/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1\/31,560 (SD=15) or 1\/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1\/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000\/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1\/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000\/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1\/161 would drop to about 1\/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1\/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US\/Chinese population ratio of about 1\/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":51}

In this setup, I have a control system to control lights (utilizing the x10 protocol), blinds, a Nest thermostat and two web cams.\nWith the recent record setting DDoS attacks utilizing unsecured IoT devices, I'd like to secure my small setup a bit. \nWhat can a home user do to secure their network while still maintaining the \"connect from anywhere\" aspect that is a big part of the marketing?","The absolute most common issue with IoT devices is default passwords. So change all the passwords. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 random (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.\n\nIf the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.\n\nThe second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device. Connections should always go through a gateway that itself requires authentication to cross, and that you keep patched with any security updates.\n\nYou should also apply security updates on all the device if they exist at all, which can be a problem."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":382}

Under 100 words is a good title length.\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE\/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.","Here is a title for this paragraph:\nDevelopment and evaluation of an efficient 3-noncoding region-based SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV."],"source":"nlp","idx":823}

{"conversations":["How to get a known traveler number?","If you love traveling but can't stand the long customs lines, then it might be worth it for you to get a Known Traveler Number (KTN). A KTN is a number that's issued by either the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Department of Defense (DoD). This number indicates that the person who has it has undergone a pre-flight background check before checking in for their flight and is eligible for an expedited customs experience. To get a KTN, apply for TSA Precheck, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI.\n\n## Get a ktn through tsa precheck\n\n1. Go for TSA Precheck if you only travel within the United States. If you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you just travel within the United States, this may be the program for you. Get your KTN through TSA Precheck so that you don't have to bother with getting a passport.\n2. Pre-enroll for TSA Precheck online. In order to start the application process, visit https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov. Here, you'll disclose basic biographical information, such as your name, birthdate, and address.\n3. Make an appointment at an application center. After you finish filling out the brief form, you'll be prompted to make an appointment for your interview. For TSA Precheck, you can choose from over 300 locations within the United States. Find a location near you by going to https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov\/locator.\n4. Go to your in-person interview. Before you head to your scheduled interview, make sure that you have a valid photo ID, a valid proof of citizenship, and immigration documentation if applicable. The interview should only take about 15 minutes, and you'll be asked questions about yourself and your travel habits, and you'll also be fingerprinted during this time. Your driver's license can serve as a valid photo ID. Your passport or birth certificate can serve as a valid proof of citizenship.\n5. Pay the $85 application fee. At the interview, you'll need to pay your nonrefundable application fee, which will cover the cost of having a background check done. You can pay with a credit card, money order, company check, or cashier's check.\n6. Check your application status online. After your interview, check the status of your application by going to https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov\/workflows?workflow=service-status&servicecode=11115V. You'll likely receive a notification letter within 1-2 days of your interview, but it can sometimes take up to 45 days. If you're approved, your notification letter will include your 9-digit KTN.\n7. Add your KTN to each reservation. Every time you book a flight, type in your KTN number wherever it's asked for. This way, you'll be recognized as a known traveler, which means you won't have to take off your shoes, belt, or jacket, or take out your laptop or liquids. If you book through a travel agent, be sure to give the travel agent you KTN. Contact your airline via phone or online to add your KTN to your reservation after you've already booked it.\n\n\n## Apply for global entry\n\n1. Choose Global Entry if you travel internationally. While TSA Precheck allows you to to enjoy a faster customs experience while traveling within the United States, Global Entry allows you to breeze through customs while traveling within the United States and also internationally. Get your KTN through Global Entry if you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you travel outside the country. You can also apply for Global Entry if you are a citizen of India, citizen of Colombia, citizen of the United Kingdom, citizen of Germany, citizen of Panama, citizen of Singapore, citizen of South Korea, citizen of Switzerland, or a Mexican National.\n2. Create a GOES account and apply for Global Entry. Navigate to https:\/\/ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click \u201cGet Started\u201d to create an account. Then, log into your account. You'll have several different programs to choose from, so make sure you click on \u201cGlobal Entry\u201d and then fill out the application. This should take about half an hour and will require information such as your passport information, your residence history, and your employment history.\n3. Pay the $100 application fee online. At the end of the Global Entry application, you will be prompted to fill in your credit card or bank account information in order to pay for the application fee. The fee is $100 and is valid for 5 years. Some credit cards, specifically the ones designed for frequent fliers and corporate travelers, may reimburse you for this fee.\n4. Wait to receive an email. Once you've applied and paid the fee, check your inbox for an email. You can expect this email to come within a week or so of submitting the application. The email will prompt you to log in to your GOES account, which will notify you that you're approved, pending your interview, if everything on your application checked out. If you don't receive an email, try calling the Global Entry customer service phone line at 866-530-4172.\n5. Schedule an interview at an enrollment center. While logged into your GOES account, you'll be prompted to pick an interview day, time, and location. Here, you can look up the enrollment centers that are closest to where you are. If you live in or near a major city, look into a few different locations, as some may be able to take you the next day but others may have a month-long wait.\n6. Go to your scheduled interview. The interview questions are typically simple and straightforward. You can expect to be asked about basic topics such as your traveling tendencies and your employment status. If you're approved, your fingerprints will be taken and you'll get your KTN at the end of the interview.\n7. Scan your passport at an airport kiosk to use your KTN. Bring your passport to the airport every time you fly, and scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. Then, the kiosk will take your photo, scan your fingerprints, and print out your receipt, which you'll hand to the customs agent. This will get you access to an expedited customs experience.\n\n\n## Become a member of nexus\n\n1. Apply for NEXUS if you travel to Canada often. NEXUS is similar to Global Entry, but it only allows you to move through customs quicker when you're traveling domestically within the U.S. or you're crossing the border of the United States and Canada. Choose this program if you're a lawful Canadian citizen\/permanent resident or a lawful U.S. citizen\/permanent resident who needs to frequently cross the border. You can go to Canada without a passport if you're a U.S. citizen and you become a member of NEXUS.\n2. Create a GOES account. Get online and navigate to ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click on \u201cRegister in English\u201d and fill out the prompted information to create a GOES account. When you're done, you'll receive an identification number and be a registered GOES user.\n3. Complete the NEXUS application online. Through your GOES account, download the NEXUS application online. Complete it, and provide copies of all of the government documents that the application requires, including your proof of citizenship or permanent residence, a valid passport, and proof of your current residence. Submit the application when you're finished with it.\n4. Pay the $50 fee online. The processing fee for applying to become a member of NEXUS is $50, which is the most affordable of all of the program fees. Pay this online with a credit card through your GOES account.\n5. Schedule an interview through your GOES account. Once your application has been processed, you'll get a notification through your GOES account that you need to schedule an interview at an enrollment center. There are only a few locations where you can do this, and all of them can be found at http:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/prog\/nexus\/location-eng.html.\n6. Gather required documents and forms of ID for your NEXUS interview. You'll need to bring a valid driver's license, proof of residency, your NEXUS conditional approval letter, and any documents that you used on your application to prove you're a U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident, Canadian citizen, or Canadian permanent resident. Bring your vehicle's title and registration if you plan to drive across the border. Bring your proof of custody if you plan to take a child under the age of 18 across the border.\n7. Go to your NEXUS interview. Attend your scheduled interview at the location you chose. Your interview should take about 30 minutes, and you'll be asked questions by both a U.S. customs officer and a Canadian customs officer during this time. If the interview goes well and you're approved for membership, you'll also be fingerprinted. During the interview, you might be asked questions like, \u201cWhy do you want a NEXUS card?\u201d or \u201cDo you still live at this address?\u201d\n8. Scan your passport at Global Entry kiosks when you travel. As a NEXUS member, you can use your KTN the same way that Global Entry members use it. When you travel, find a Global Entry kiosk, scan your passport, and proceed as the kiosk guides you to. Just like with Global Entry members, you can give the receipt that \u2018s printed at this kiosk to the customs agent in order to have an expedited customs experience.\n9. Add your PASSID to your reservations and frequent flier profiles. When you become a NEXUS member, you'll be issued a PASSID, which is exactly the same as a KTN. If you'd rather check in before heading to the airport, be sure to include your PASSID in the appropriate field when you fill out your flight registration information.\n\n\n## Acquire your ktn through sentri\n\n1. Choose SENTRI if you travel to Mexico often. The benefits of being a SENTRI member are specific to crossing the U.S. and Mexican border. Go with this program to get your KTN if you're a lawful U.S. citizen who travels to Mexico on a regular basis.\n2. Create a GOES account online. SENTRI is another program that requires you to have a GOES account. Register by clicking \u201cGet Started,\u201d and filling out all of the prompted information on https:\/\/ttp.cbp.dhs.gov.\n3. Complete an online application. After you've gotten a GOES account, you can log in and find the application for SENTRI. Fill it out entirely and include copies of any documents that the application requires of you. You'll likely need to supply copies of your passport and your proof of citizenship or proof of permanent residence.\n4. Pay the SENTRI fee of $122.25. This fee covers the application fee, the fingerprint fee, as well as the system cost fee. After you finish filling out the application, you'll have an opportunity to pay this nonrefundable fee. Make the payment with a credit card, certified check, money order, or through electronic bank transfer.\n5. Schedule to your SENTRI interview at an enrollment center. Once your application is conditionally approved, you'll be instructed through your GOES account to make an appointment for your interview. There are many different locations that you can choose from, all of which are considered \u201cenrollment centers.\u201d\n6. Go to your scheduled interview with the required documents. Bring the required documents with you and answer the interviewer's questions truthfully. You'll then be approved and fingerprinted if the interview goes well.\n7. Scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. To reap the benefits of your SENTRI membership, head to the Global Entry kiosk and scan your passport before you go to customs. The kiosk will prompt you to answer a couple of questions and it will take your photo and scan your fingerprints. It will then print out a receipt that you can give to the customs agent so that you can move quickly through.\n8. Include your PASSID in your flight reservations. If you'd rather not worry about dealing with the kiosk before your flight, you can simply include your PASSID (KTN) on your reservation when you book your flight. That way, your precheck privileges will be noted on your boarding pass and you can skip the kiosk altogether.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":695}

If you leave the States and Territories your voting rights depend on former residence or inheritance.\n\nIn general most citizens of the USA are also citizens of a state of the USA.  Since states don't issue their own passports, your citizenship of a state is determined by residence.  If a New Yorker moves to Florida, they become Floridians, and so can vote in state elections in Florida, but can't now vote in elections in New York.\n\nNow if our New Yorker moves to Timbuktu, this is treated slightly differently.  They remain a US citizen and a citizen of New York, and so retain the right to vote in New York elections. Their children could also claim New York citizenship.\n\nBut Puerto Rico is both part of the USA but not a State or part of a State of the USA.

{"conversations":["What is the difference between a mode and a scale?","A **scale** is a sequence of ascending or descending unit pitches that form a palette of notes that can be used to form a melody. Most scales in Western music conform to a particular key; that is, a sequence of notes that will be sharp or flat by default. Not all scales have keys; the chromatic scale is a scale of all possible semitone steps used in Western music, while the whole-tone scale is a scale composed of intervals two semitones apart.\nWithin a particular key, there are 7 notes in a single octave, before reaching the 8th note which is named the same as the first note and is at double the frequency. The seven notes have differing intervals between adjacent notes; sometimes it's one half-step (semitone), while other times it's a whole step (two semitones). The pattern of whole-step\/half-step intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting from the note for while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, each of those seven notes could be used as the base note of an ascending sequence. Each such sequence, created by starting on a different note in the key, is a **mode** of that key, and each mode has a name:\n\n* Ionian - starts on the tonic; the note for which the key is named. In the key of C, the Ionian mode starts on C. This mode is the most common, and colloquially called the **major scale**. The pattern is WWHWWWH.\n* Dorian - starts on the next note higher in the key than the tonic (D, in the key of C). WHWWWHW.\n* Phrygian - starts on the note one major third higher than the tonic (E). HWWWHWW.\n* Lydian - starts on the note one perfect fourth higher than the tonic (F). WWWHWWH.\n* Mixolydian - starts on the note one perfect fifth higher than the tonic (G). WWHWWHW.\n* Aeolian - starts on the note one major sixth higher than the tonic (A). In modern music, this mode is also very important, and is referred to as the **natural minor scale**. WHWWHWW.\n* Locrian - starts on the note one major seventh higher than the tonic (B). HWWHWWW.","So, can I play the C Aeolian mode while playing in the key of C(major)?","You can; that would be the same as playing in the key of A minor. Within the same key signature, you can start on any of the scale degrees and think of that as your root note, and then you're playing in a mode. You can even switch between modes mid-piece. For examples, take a look at Bach's fugues, especially the ones in a minor key; certain passages will sound \"happier\" than others, because the motif that forms the fugue is being played up two scale degrees from the root of the key, and thus in the Ionian mode of that key signature."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1016}

{"conversations":["How to make hand\u2010marbled fabrics?","If you like marbled paper, you might like marbled fabric too. It is surprisingly easy to create. The most traditional method uses carrageenan and water to create a thick base, but you can also use shaving cream instead. The traditional method takes a while to prepare, but the results are worth it. The shaving cream method is much faster, but it can get messy! Whichever method you choose, you are bound to end up with something unique and beautiful.\n\n## Use water and carrageenan\n\n1. Soak white fabric in a solution of alum and water the day before. In a bucket, combine 2 tablespoons (26 grams) of alum and 2 gallons (8 liters) of water. Soak your fabric in the solution for 20 minutes, then take it out. Wring out the excess water, then hang the fabric up to dry. Do not rinse the alum out of the fabric. Alum can irritate skin. It would be a good idea to wear gloves. Use white fabric that is lightweight and smooth in texture, such as muslin, cotton, light linen, or silk. Avoid heavy fabrics, such as canvas.\n2. Combine 2 tablespoons (10 grams) of carrageenan and 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Mix the two together using a blender or hand\/immersion blender. Start by mixing the carrageenan 1 teaspoon at a time into 2 cups (475 milliliters) of water, then add the solution to the rest of the water. It is best to prepare this in the pitcher to make the next step easier. Do not use the leftover alum water for this.\n3. Refrigerate the solution for 12 to 24 hours. You can do this at the same time as you are soaking the fabric in the alum. Once the 12 to 24 hours are up, take the pitcher out of the fridge, and let it come to room temperature, about 1 hour.\n4. Pour the solution into a large, plastic tub, and let it sit for at least 3 hours. The water is ready once it turns clear. The tub needs to be long enough and wide enough for the fabric to sit inside it, with at least a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) border on all sides of the fabric the fabric.The water needs to be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) deep. If you don't have enough water, you should make another batch.\n5. Dilute the acrylic paints with some fresh water. Choose 1 to 3 colors of acrylic paint, then pour each color into a small cup. Stir in enough water into each cup so that the paint takes on the consistency of heavy whipping cream. Do not use the carrageenan water for this.\n6. Place droplets of paint over the surface of the water. You can do this with an eyedropper or a pipette. Drop the paint close to the surface of the water; don't hold your hand high above it. You want the paint to float. If it sinks into the water, you are either dropping it from too high up, or the paint is too thick. If the paint is too thick, add some more water to it. Use a new dropper or pipette for each color.\n7. Swirl the paint drops together. There is no right or wrong way to o this. You can swirl the droplets together in a spiral with a toothpick. You can also drag a toothpick back-and-forth, then up-and-down through the water. You can even use a fork or a wide-toothed comb to do this.\n8. Gently lay the fabric on top of the water. Do not press the fabric into or under the water; you want it sitting right on the surface. If you see any air bubbles, gently poke them until the fabric lays smoothly against the surface again. If your fabric has a right and wrong side, make sure you are placing it right-side-down. Hold the fabric by the sides as you lower it onto the water so that the middle touches the surface first.\n9. Lift the fabric out and set it down onto a sheet of newspaper to dry. If you are worried about the ink transferring to the fabric, you can use blank newsprint or paper backs instead. At this point, you can dip another piece of fabric into the stray. You can also use a sheet of paper to collect the leftover paint, then drop and swirl new paint onto the surface.\n10. Allow the fabric to dry, then rinse it in cold water. Hang the fabric up to dry, preferably in the sun. Once the fabric is completely dry, rinse it with cold water, then hang it up to dry again.\n11. Iron the fabric after it dries to help set the paint into it. Cover the fabric with a tea towel or ironing cloth first, then pass an iron over it. Use a setting suitable for the type of fabric you are using (cotton, linen, silk, etc. ).\n\n\n## Use shave cream\n\n1. Wash the fabric using washing soda and hot water. This will not only remove any finishes that might prevent the paint from adhering, but it will also pre-shrink the fabric as well. Once the fabric is dry, you can press it flat with an iron, but this is not absolutely necessary. Cotton will work the best here, but you can use other, non-synthetic fabric as well.\n2. Coat a shallow tray with plain shaving cream. Spread the shaving cream around the tray so that you have a thick, even layer from edge-to-edge, corner-to-corner. For best results, use plain, white shaving cream, with no added dyes, oils, or perfumes. You will be spreading your fabric out in this tray, so make sure that the tray is big enough for it.\n3. Place drops of fabric paint randomly on top of the shaving cream. Try to space the drops randomly. Fabric paint will work the best, but you can use acrylic paint as well. If you are going to use acrylic paint, go for the bottled kind rather than the kind that comes in a tube; it is thinner and easier to drop out. Use one color for a simple effect, and two or three colors for a fancier effect. Use regular fabric paint. Don't use \"puffy paint\" or \"dimensional fabric paint.\"\n4. Swirl the paint around with a toothpick. Weave a toothpick through the shaving cream side-to-side and top-to-bottom. Feel free to add some spirals in there as well. Be careful not to over-stir the paint, however; you want the shaving cream to look streaky. You can also use other items to swirl the paint, such as pencils or chopsticks.\n5. Place the fabric on top of the shaving cream, then gently pat it down. Keep patting it until you can see the paint patterns appearing on the other side of the fabric. If your fabric has a distinct right and wrong side, set it right-side-down.\n6. Lift the fabric away and set it down on top of a trash bag. Make sure that you are setting it with the shaving cream side facing up. If you don't have any trash bags, you can use a plastic tablecloth, wax paper, or even a paper bag. Pull the fabric away at a slight angle rather than straight up. This will prevent the fabric from taking too much of the shaving cream with it.\n7. Scrape the shaving cream off. Hold the fabric down firmly by one end. Place a long, metal ruler on top of the fabric, with one of the edges facing down. Run the ruler across the fabric to scrape the shaving cream off. You may have to do a few passes; be sure to wipe the ruler clean before each one.\n8. Allow the paint to dry before heat setting it with an iron. Let the fabric out to dry, preferably in the sun. Once it is dry, place a tea towel or an ironing cloth over it, then iron it. Be sure to use a heat setting appropriate for the type of fabric you are working with.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":644}

{"conversations":["In our computer systems lecture we were introduced to the MIPS processor. It was (re)developed over the course of the term and has in fact been quite easy to understand. It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.\nIt was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!\nSo I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they? ","There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the \u201coriginal\u201d 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":1}

This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow.\n4. Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number \u201c8.\u201d\n5. Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path.\n6. Stop making loops when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric left. Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each.\n7. Thread the piece of floral wire around the fabric you've been pinching. Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place.\n8. Cut the middle of the last big loop you made to form the tails of the bow. Cut in the middle of the fabric and watch as the ends fall down, creating the tails of your bow. You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want.\n9. Shape the ribbon by rearranging the loops. Spread out the loops until you create a large, fluffy, full-looking bow. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape.\n\n\n## Create a bow from unwire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Leave this piece of wire off to the side somewhere you can find it easily later on. You'll use it to secure your bow once you're finished making it. If you don't have floral wire, use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Take your ribbon and make a twist at the end of it. Use at least 2 feet (0.61 m) of ribbon for this bow. Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends. If you're using ribbon that isn't patterned on both sides, just make sure that the patterned or colored side is on the outside of the twist.\n3. Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be\u2014use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another.\n4. Stop making loops on an even number. Make anywhere from 6-10 loops (or more, if you're going for a really large bow!) before you stop. The even number helps create symmetry in your bow.\n5. Cut off your bow from the rest of the ribbon. Cut the ribbon so that there are roughly equal-sized tails on each side. If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on. It's okay if the edge is a little jagged\u2014you can tidy it up later on.\n6. Thread your floral wire through the center of the bow. Position the wire so that half of the loops are on one side and the rest are on the other. Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n7. Spread out the loops to create a fluffy bow! Position the loops in all directions so that it looks full. Because this bow is made of unwired fabric, it might look a little loose, but that's part of the beauty of it! If you want, you can also cut small triangles out of the ends of the tails for an added flourish.\n\n\n## Craft a rustic bow with burlap\n\n1. Cut off 3 separate sections of burlap ribbon. Make one piece 60 inches (150 cm), one 24 inches (61 cm), and the last one 8 inches (20 cm). Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath.\n2. Hold the large ribbon in the center, and fold the sides down and across. Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat.\n3. Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow.\n4. Gather the fabric in the middle of your ribbons to make a bow shape. Pinch the fabric together in the very middle to create the 2 sides of your bow, and hold the fabric together using your non-dominant hand. One side of the bow should be a mirror reflection of the other side.\n5. Wrap your floral wire around the center of the bow. Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n6. Cover the floral wire with the halved 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap. Wrap it around several times until there isn't any excess ribbon to be wrapped around. If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!\n7. Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.\n8. Cut out triangles from the ends of the \u201ctails\u201d for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":791}
{"conversations":["How to deal with a married boyfriend?","Entering into a relationship with a married man might seem appealing to some women; however, it can also become a very difficult and painful experience.  There are many reasons why a woman might be attracted to a married man and learning these reasons as well as the difficulties of such a relationship can help you decide what to do.\n\n## Learn the risk\n\n1. Be aware that he likely won't leave his wife. Although your boyfriend may claim he is willing to or about to leave his wife, most married men are not actually ready or planning to do so. During your time with your boyfriend, you should understand that the chances of him leaving his wife to be with you exclusively are small. If he is finalizing his divorce, then he may actually be serious about leaving his wife. Most men will not leave their wife to be with their girlfriend.\n2. Realize that he will always be connected to his family. If your boyfriend has children with his wife, you should understand that he will always have a connection to his children and possibly with his wife. Even if your boyfriend leaves his wife, his children will still be part of his life and he may be required to share visitation rights with her. Be prepared for this if you continue to pursue your relationship with him.\n3. Prepare yourself for a difficult relationship. Dating a married man is almost always a difficult relationship and is one that is likely to emotionally hurt those involved. You should be fully aware of this if you plan to continue your relationship with your married boyfriend.\n\n\n## Understand why women want to date a marry man\n\n1. Examine your relationship for any thrill seeking behavior. The hidden nature of your relationship may be what keeps one or both of you interested. Sneaking around, keeping secrets and hiding the relationship can all be exhilarating and boost the attachment between the two of you. Understand that if you are interested in your boyfriend because of the thrill, an exclusive relationship with him will likely lose its appeal.\n2. Ask yourself if you have based the relationship in competition. Some women are highly competitive and this competitive nature can express itself in relationships as well. Women who desire a married man may do so because they feel that they are a superior woman to the man's wife. This can cause them to pursue the husband in order to prove to themselves and others that they are the \u201cwinner\u201d.\n3. Discover any issues with trust that you may have. Some women may have difficulty trusting a man. The appeal of seeing a married man is found in the fact that they can't be cheated on because they are the one doing the cheating. Women who have a married boyfriend are also not likely to be restricted in who they themselves are allowed to see romantically. A lack of trust can be the reason behind your relationship.\n\n\n## Date during a divorce\n\n1. Be aware of your boyfriend's wife. Although you may be dating your boyfriend during his divorce, you will still have to contend with how his wife might view you. You will have to be careful with any interaction you might have with your boyfriend's wife as they may feel resentful towards you and try to cause you trouble. Your boyfriends wife may try to turn his children against you. The wife of your boyfriend might try to attack your image amongst family and friends. Your relationship may cause the divorce proceedings to take longer or become more expensive.\n2. Keep your relationship discreet. Dating your boyfriend during a divorce can be a troublesome and difficult time for both of you. Keeping your relationship discreet and private can help keep things as calm and stable as can be during the divorce proceedings. Wait until after the divorce before making your relationship a public one. Don't get involved with your boyfriend's children until after the divorce is finalized.\n3. Make sure your boyfriend is physically separated from his wife. If you start dating your boyfriend while he still lives with his wife, this might be legally determined to be the reason for the failure of his marriage. If your relationship is determined to be the reason his marriage failed it can cause your boyfriend to lose more of his assets during the divorce. Wait until your boyfriend is living away from his wife before dating.\n\n\n## Discover if your boyfriend be marry\n\n1. Take note of when your boyfriend is available. If your boyfriend is usually unavailable on weekends of evenings, but talks to you first thing in the morning, he might be married. Your boyfriend might be with his wife during these times and this can be the reason he isn't returning your calls or texts. Take note of when your boyfriend is available to talk. If he talks with you only during times when he is at work or away from home, he might be married. Unless he has to work on the weekends, he should be able to meet or talk with you.\n2. Think about how much you know about his personal life. Married men don't often share many details of their personal life. This might be an effort to cover up their marriage by exuding any information that could reveal it. Think of how much you know about your boyfriend and his personal life to see if he might be withholding any important information. He will likely not mention where he lives. Your boyfriend might not talk about his friends in case you might know them and ask them for more details about his life. He might not talk about his past relationships in order to avoid revealing anything about his current marriage.\n3. Ask yourself if your boyfriend hides his family from you. If your boyfriend is currently married there is a good chance that he will avoid taking you to meet his family. A married boyfriend will likely try to keep your relationship a secret. If you meet his family your relationship will be revealed. If you have been dating your boyfriend for a long period of time and he avoids a meeting between you and his family, he might be married.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":697}

{"conversations":["You are asleep on your boat on open sea. When you wake up you discover you have been robbed. A quick inspection of security cam footage reveals that the pirates who robbed you left your ship exactly an hour ago. The sea is flat, extends indefinitely, and is fully covered in a thick persistent fog. You have no idea in which direction the pirates fled. But you do know that these pirates always continue in a straight line at full speed away from their victim. Their maximum speed on open water is 20 nautical miles per hour. Your boat can reach 21 nautical miles per hour. \nHow do you catch the pirates?","If we assume the ocean is flat and extends indefinitely in all directions, there is a strategy that guarantees we can catch the pirates in at most 800,000 years.\n\nPut our current location as the origin of a coordinate system. We will describe our position in polar coordinates, as a function of time: $(r(t),\\theta(t))$ (where we have arbitrarily chosen a direction to be $\\theta=0$, and $t=0$ is when we realized we had been robbed).\n\nWe begin by traveling in the $\\theta=0$ direction for 20 hours, putting our position at $(420, 0)$. We are then the same distance from the origin as the pirates. Next, we will travel in a spiral, in a manner so that $r'(t)=20$ at all times. This guarantees we will always be the same distance from the origin as the pirates. For $t\\geq 20$, we will have $r(t)=420+20(t-20)=20t+20$.\n\nOur speed is\n$$\n\\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2(\\theta')^2} = 21\\text{ mph},\n$$\nand $r'(t)=20$ for $t>20$, so\n$$\n\\theta'(t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{41}{r^2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{20+20t}.\n$$\nIf there is a $t\\geq 20$ for which $\\theta(t)$ is the angle in which the pirates fled, we will catch them.

If you're prepared to get a little greasy and do the legwork yourself, you can find yourself back on the road and enjoying the drive-in on time.\n\n## Patch a puncture tire\n\n1. Locate the tire that is losing air. Remove your valve caps first. You can either find the hole by looking for the nail that is pierced through the tire, or you can put the tire in a tub of water and roll it around in driving rotation. There should be air bubbles where the hole is.\n2. Take the tire off from the rim. This allows the puncture to be easily accessed.\n3. Remove anything that's in the tire. If you have found the hole, and there is a nail punctured through it, use your pliers. Grab from the threading of the nail and lift out the nail. Mark the hole with tire chalk for easy access.\n4. Once the hole is clear, squirt some buffering solution over the puncture. This allows the buffer to work effectively and leave you with a smooth surface.\n5. Grab your buffer machine. Make sure that you have a sanding pad surface on your buffer to get a smooth surface. Buff all around the punctured area in a circular motion to make sure you get everywhere you need.\n6. Use a Tire Radial Patch. You can start by first removing the sticky pads of the inner side of the Radial Patch. Then from the inside of the tire, you can stick the Radial Patch through the hole about halfway with the aluminum side first.\n7. Spread the Tire Chemical Care (Seal Fast B-133). Using the brush at the end of the cap, spread the liquid material all around the Radial Patch string as shown in the picture.\n8. Pull the rest of the Radial Patch through the tire. You must pull all the way through until the patch completely sits on the inner side of the tire, and the aluminum piece comes out of the rubber.\n9. Cut the long leftover end of the patch using your cutting pliers. Scissors will work too. As shown in the picture, you want to cut as low as you can.\n10. Roll over the patch. Using your Tire Retread and Repair Tool, run over the Radial Patch from the inside of the tire. You can roll it in any direction, as long as you make sure to get every spot of the patch. Once the steps have been completed, your tire is ready to hit me back on the rims and filled to the pressure needed to be back on the road.\n\n\n## Temporary fix on a puncture tire\n\n1.

{"conversations":["Nowadays each graphic card has some driver in operating system that translates some (typically) standard API such as OpenGL, so that programmers use some standardized API code to tell graphics cards how and what they want to render. (Actually that's already a bit hard-core most programmers really use various game engines that do this for them). In times of old computers - how was this done? Did every programmer of every game implemented all possible various API's that old graphic cards supported? Or did the old game studios from MS-DOS times had their own \"game engines\" that provided some abstraction when it came to these graphic cards? I remember there were many various card vendors and I remember old games asked me which one I have - so I suppose these games contained code \/ drivers for all these cards?","> Did every programmer of every game implemented all possible various API's that old graphic cards supported?\n\nYes - but it went even deeper than that. Early graphics cards had virtually no callable code associated with them at all, the concept of \"drivers\" had not quite become a reality yet. There was the concept of a Video BIOS, which were extensions to the ```INT 10h``` BIOS video services, that were effectively limited to initialization and switching video modes. \nInstead, graphics cards, at least in DOS land, all had memory mapped display RAM, and extensive documentation was available about exactly how setting various bits in display RAM would affect the pixels that appeared on the screen. There were no drawing APIs to call, if you wanted something to appear on the screen (whether it be a pixel, a character, a line, a circle, a sprite, etc) you would write the code to move the bytes into the right places in display RAM. Entire books were written about how to write efficient code to draw graphics.\nThere were some systems like the Borland Graphics Interface that abstracted graphics drawing primitives into an API with different drivers that one could call to draw things on different graphics cards. However, these were typically slower than what would be required for building action type games.\nAn action game would typically be optimized for a particular graphics display mode on a particular card. For example, a popular display mode was VGA 640x480 with 16 colors. This would be listed in the software requirements, and you needed to have the right hardware to support the game. If you bought a VGA game but you only had an EGA card, then the game would not work at all.

Whip the two eggs together with the vanilla in a small bowl. It should be well blended and mixed. When done, set it aside for later. To make richer churros, you can add 1-2 more eggs, though this is totally up to taste.\n2. Heat up 1-1\/2\" of oil in a large frying pan until 375\u00b0F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, keep everything on medium-low, and you'll be ready just as small amounts of \"smoke\" is rising from the top of the oil. If you drop a small test ball of dough in, the oil should immediately start bubbling. A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans. You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning.\n3. In a medium saucepan, add the water, brown sugar, salt, and butter and heat until boiling. Stir it frequently, until everything is well dissolved and the mixture is bubbling nicely. Once it is a consistent, boiling mixture, immediately lower the heat to low.\n4. Add the flour to the hot water mixture all at once, stirring until a firm dough. This takes some arms, so really get in there with a wooden spoon to stir everything up into it is well blended. Turn the heat off when done.\n5. Pour the egg\/vanilla mixture in and stir until you have a consistent dough. You should have a glossy ball of dough when you've mixed everything up completely. If you pull up on the dough sharply, it should keep it's hook shape. If it doesn't add and beat in another egg.\n6. Consider how you want to make the long, round shapes churros are famous for. There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats:\n\t* \n\t* Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2\" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1\/2\" thick. Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough. DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs.\n7. Fry the logs in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently. The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros.\n8. Drain the finished churros on paper towels. Set them aside on a plate of paper towels, then lightly pat down the tops with more paper towels to get rid of excess oil.\n9. Combine white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and roll the churros in the mixture. You've got your finished churros! Combine them in as much or as little cinnamon sugar as you want -- they'll be delicious either way. Some people take things a step further by drizzling the finished churros in chocolate sauce, too.\n\n\n## Make \"instant\" churros\n\n1. Purchase a roll of pre-made biscuits from your favorite brand. The dough in a \"real\" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything. If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1\/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal.\n2. Take two biscuits and roll them in between your hands into ten-inch ropes. Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.\n3. Twist biscuits together and pinch ends. Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.\n4. Alternatively, use an icing pipette or icing bag to pump out the strips. Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.\n5. Pour vegetable oil into a medium-sized frying pan. Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time. If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.\n6. Drop the dough twists into the pan, turning occasionally. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.\n7. Remove the churros with the slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel. Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.\n8. Roll the twisted dough in cinnamon and sugar mixture. In a separate bowl, mix up 1\/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.\n9. Serve warm, with chocolate dip if desired. They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip. Enjoy!\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":756}

{"conversations":["How to be a lazy college student?","In college, unlike in high school, you are expected to take responsibility for your own learning.  It is ultimately up to you to determine how much time and effort you want to put into your schoolwork. Experts suggest that college students today work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts did in 1961.  But there is also evidence that working more hours is not necessarily the best way to be productive. A little laziness may even be good for us.\n\n## Part 1 of 3: prioritize what's important\n\n1. Ask yourself what you want from college. There are many reasons why a college degree is desirable, not least that it is still considered highly valuable by many employers. Your own reasons for pursuing a college degree may be more personal, but spend some time working out exactly what these reasons are. Consider why college is important to you. Do you want to learn important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving? Do you want to make friends, network and get to know other people? Do you want to get good grades for further study? Do you want to get a particular job that requires a college degree? Spend some time reflecting on these questions and come up with your own answers. It might even be a good idea to write them down. This will help you to recognize what's important to you so that you can focus on the essential things.\n2. Select your major and your classes carefully. After you have determined what's important to you as a college student, then you can make better decisions about pursuing a major or particular class that will help you achieve your goals. Speak to your academic advisor. It is their job to provide information about what certain majors entail and what courses are necessary. Ask other students for information about the class. Ask questions like, is the course time-consuming? Is the professor fair? What are the assignments like? If you don't know any other students, look online. There are many websites, some more general and others specific to particular schools where students share this kind of information. Be aware that what is on these sites are merely individual opinions, and your own experience of the course may be different.\n3. Complete as much coursework as you can before the semester gets going. Preparation is key and doing what you can before the semester starts will help things run more smoothly later on. For example, ask the professor for a copy of the syllabus ahead of time so that you can order the necessary materials before the semester starts. Familiarize yourself with the course materials. You can even start reading early to get ahead!\n4. Figure out what is actually required to do well in the class. This is key to being a lazy, yet productive, college student. Professors often cut material from the syllabus as the class goes on. Usually, the syllabus contains more material than it is possible to get through in a single semester. Ask your professor what is required reading and what materials or course readings may be more supplementary, i.e. they will not appear on exams or in assignments. Pay attention to what kinds of materials come up most frequently in lectures. For example, there may be a textbook chapter and several articles assigned for each class, yet the professor usually focuses on the textbook chapters in lecture. If you can determine a pattern then you can use this in your own preparation for the class.\n5. Streamline your commitments. Being a college student is not simply about going to class, many students are also part of sports teams, fraternities\/ sororities, student associations and take on other voluntary roles. These are obviously important and worthwhile activities, but ask yourself if there are any commitments you could scale back on. Identify particular commitments that are not necessary to the goals that you have chosen to focus on. Accept that you can't do everything.\n\n\n## Part 2 of 3: make the most of your time\n\n1. Get things done at the right time. Timing is essential to being a lazy college student. While procrastination can be appealing, there are some activities that are best done at certain times. Here are some examples. Do your homework straight after class when the content is fresh in your mind. This will save you time as you won't have to re-visit the material at a later date when you might have forgotten it. Write out an essay plan or outline immediately after discussing it with the teaching assistant or professor in office hours. Again, if you spend some time getting your ideas on paper at the right moment then you'll save yourself time in the future because you won't have to worry about all the good ideas you might have forgotten.\n2. Take good notes. At some point, you will have to engage with the course materials. If you take good notes the first time around, then at the end of the semester or when an assignment is due you can use these notes and avoid having to re-visit what you have already read. Write good summaries. Try to distill the argument of a text or the main points in a chapter into a single paragraph. This will serve you well when you come back to look at your notes. Figure out if typing notes works best for you or if you prefer to write them long-hand. Annotate and highlight the text. Use sticky notes to mark important parts.\n3. Learn how to read quickly. Most college courses require you to read a high volume of complex material. Learning to read quickly and effectively is one of the key skills you learn in college. Preview the passage before you start reading it. Take a minute or two to look at the title, the headings or subheadings, any pictures, charts or graphs. Skim over the passage by reading the first and last paragraph, and the first sentence of every paragraph. Researchers suggest that these techniques improves reading comprehension, which will ultimately save you time as you already begin reading with a sense of what's important in the passage. Read in the right environment so that you actually take in what you are reading. This will prevent wasting time by re-reading certain parts that you missed. This requires good lighting, a comfortable upright reading position, minimal distraction and regular breaks.\n4. Utilize \"dead\" time. This refers to the hours in the day spent in routine, non-productive tasks. The idea is that focusing on these key moments can actually give you more free time to relax and be lazy. For example, those 30 minutes spent staring out the bus window during your daily commute could be utilized for productive tasks like reading over your notes or listening to the lecture that you recorded. If you have free time in between classes, go to the library or the nearest cafe and spend the time studying.\n\n\n## Part 3 of 3: learn other ways to work efficiently\n\n1. Take advantage of college resources. Colleges often provide writing centers and tutoring services to their students. It is a good idea to make use of these services as they will help you get the work done faster and prevent you wasting time being stuck on a particular problem or difficult assignment.\n2. Form a study group. Collaborating with other students in study groups can be an excellent way to share the workload. When prepping for the final exam, delegate different topics to different members of the study group to make notes on. This can be a great time saver, although you will obviously still need to make sure that you are familiar with all the course content. Make sure everyone in the study group is on the same page and shares the work equally.\n3. Seek help from your professor. Remember there is no shame in getting help when you need it. Most professors and teaching assistants have weekly office hours. They can help you strategize for success in the class. Get advice on assignments and exam preparation, often this will prevent you wasting time on what isn't essential to the course.\n4. Get the right technology. There is lots of technology that can help you as a college student, a laptop being the most obvious investment. Consider investing in a recording device. This can prove useful especially if you have difficulty concentrating in lecture or are going to miss a key class. Always remember to ask the professor for permission before you record them! Use software to help with referencing and citations. Many college papers, especially research papers, require correctly formatted references and bibliographies. There are many programs available to help with this, which will ultimately save you time and avoid any issues with incorrect citations.\n5. Work on managing stress. College can be stressful, for many students it is the first time living away from home and there are increasing financial pressures on students, many of whom work to sustain themselves throughout college. Acknowledge that stress is normal, but be aware that too much time spent worrying or stressing can be unhealthy and stop you from succeeding. Engage with your college's resources for managing stress. Many colleges provide programming for students to help with stress management, especially during finals period. Some key ways to manage stress are to engage in physical exercise, make time for relaxing activities, and try to get enough sleep. When it comes to managing stress, being lazy sometimes can be a good thing!\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":627}

{"conversations":["Why is kVA not the same as kW?","Both watts and volt-amps come from the same equation, $P=IV$, but the difference is how they're measured.\nTo get volt-amps, you multiply root mean square (RMS) voltage ($V$) with RMS current ($I$) with no regard for the timing\/phasing between them. This is what the wiring and pretty much all electrical\/electronic components have to deal with.\n\nTo get watts, you multiply instantaneous voltage ($V$) with instantaneous current ($I$) for every sample, then average those results. This is the energy that is actually transferred.\n\nNow to compare the two measurements:\nIf voltage and current are both sinewaves, then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps} \\times \\cos(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the phase angle between voltage and current. It's pretty easy to see from this that if they're both sine waves and if they're in phase ($\\phi = 0$), then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps}$.\n\nHowever, if you're NOT dealing with sine waves, the $\\cos(\\phi)$ relationship no longer applies! So you have to go the long way around and actually do the measurements as described here.\n\nHow might that happen? Easy. DC power supplies. They're everywhere, including battery chargers, and the vast majority of them only draw current at the peak of the AC voltage waveform because that's the only time that their filter capacitors are otherwise less than the input voltage. So they draw a big spike of current to recharge the caps, starting just before the voltage peak and ending right at the voltage peak, and then they draw nothing until the next peak.\n\nAnd of course there's an exception to this rule also, and that is Power Factor Correction (PFC). DC power supplies with PFC are specialized switching power supplies that end up producing more DC voltage than the highest AC peak, and they do it in such a way that their input current follows the input voltage almost exactly. Of course, this is only an approximation, but the goal is to get a close enough match that the $\\cos(\\phi)$ shortcut becomes acceptably close to accurate, with $\\phi \\approx 0$. Then, given this high voltage DC, a secondary switching supply produces what is actually required by the circuit being powered."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":320}

{"conversations":["What is the genetic significance of humans being either left-handed or right-handed?","Handedness is a very interesting phenomenon, but it is not as simple as being either left or right handed.\nIn most people the brain is asymmetrical, with some functions, such as language, being localised to one hemisphere. In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well. These people, while rare, do not have brains that are symmetrical, but have developed connections between the two hemispheres that allow them to access both motor cortices.\nThe genetics of handedness are complex and not well understood. There does appear to be a genetic component, but it is not straightforward. Identical twins who are brought up in the same environment are not always both left or right handed, suggesting that environmental factors also play a role.\nOne of the most interesting things about handedness is how early it becomes apparent. Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness, and it is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time. This suggests that it is very strongly influenced by genetics, with environmental factors playing a minor role."],"source":"authors","idx":433}

There will always be issues that you need human eyes on to determine though and you will never do as good a job reviewing your own stuff as someone else, there are some things you can do to help however\n\n* Check tests exist and pass (possibly have a target test coverage, though you may need to break this in certain cases, but you should be able to justify why)\n* Check Static analysis passes (there will also be false negatives here but that is fine as long as you can justify why then its fine to suppress them)\n* Maintain a check list of further things to check in review (ideally add this as new static analysis rules if possible) make sure you check anything the SA can't check, e.g., are comments still valid, are things named appropriately (naming things is of course, one of the 2 hard problems known to computer science)\n* If a fault is identified check if the cause is systemic and look at why it wasn't found in earlier tests or reviews\n\nThis of course is useful when you are reviewing others code as well"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":274}

Here is a list of Weir's three most critically-acclaimed works, including a short description and explanation for why you might want to read them:\n\n###The Martian\nDescription: An American astronaut, Mark Watney, becomes stranded alone on Mars in 2035, and must improvise in order to survive.\nWhy Read: The Martian features technical details worthy of a hard sci-fi novel with comical writing and a healthy amount of suspense. It won the Hugo Award and was adapted into a blockbuster movie.\n\n###Artemis\nDescription: Artemis takes place in the late 2080s in Artemis, the first and so far only city on the Moon. It follows the life of porter and smuggler Jasmine \"Jazz\" Bashara as she gets caught up in a conspiracy for control of the city.\nWhy Read: The novel combines the thrill of a heist with the right amount of scientific geekery associated with living on the moon. It won the Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\n\n###Project Hail Mary\nDescription: Set in the near future, Project Hail Mary centers on middle school teacher-turned-astronaut Ryland Grace, who wakes up from a coma afflicted with amnesia. He gradually remembers that he was sent to the Tau Ceti solar system, 12 light-years from Earth, to find a means of reversing a solar dimming event that could cause the extinction of humanity.\nWhy Read: Project Hail Mary is a science fiction masterpiece.

Determine which method of restoration is provided by the manufacturer. If you received a set of installation CDs with your machine, then use this. If you did not, your computer may have a restore partition set up, which means you will need to employ a different method.\n3. Insert the operating system disk into your CD\/DVD drive. It normally auto-runs and will open to a menu, or options page. Select the option for installing a fresh copy of the operating system. If the CD doesn't run by itself, double click on \"My Computer,\" and then right click on the drive with the OS disk. Click \"Auto-Run.\"\n4. Wait for the CD to proceed automatically. If you are away from the computer for awhile, it will pause at the next point, awaiting any required input from you. Follow the prompts, be patient and avoid the temptation to intervene. This process may take a few minutes. If you are reformatting your laptop hard drive, you will accept the default offerings\/settings that the installation disc is asking for.\n5. Wait for the installation to complete. When the operating system installation is complete, a completely fresh desktop will appear.\n\n\n## Reformatting a laptop use restoration partition\n\n1. Restart your computer. While the machine is rebooting, repeatedly press the F10 key on your keyboard until the machine boots. This will take you into the partition offering you options for repair or restore (reformatting and reloading).\n2. Select the option for installing a fresh system. The beauty of this system is that you don't have to do anything else.

Therefore, the indices of the `n` highest elements are:\n```\n(-avgDists).argsort()[:n]\n```\nAnother way to reason about this, as mentioned in the comments, is to observe that the big elements are coming last in the argsort. So, you can read from the tail of the argsort to find the `n` highest elements:\n```\navgDists.argsort()[::-1][:n]\n```\nBoth methods are O(n log n) in time complexity, because the argsort call is the dominant term here.

If you're working with small arrays inside loops then you may get some performance gains from avoiding that negation, and if you're working with huge arrays then you can save on memory usage because the negation creates a copy of the entire array.\n\nNote that these methods do not always give equivalent results: if a stable sort implementation is requested to argsort, e.g. by passing the keyword argument kind='mergesort', then the first strategy will preserve the sorting stability, but the second strategy will break stability (i.e. the positions of equal items will get reversed)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":303}

For example, you might be in removal proceedings. If you are, then you should make a copy of your Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing. You will need to submit these documents with your FOIA request. Also write a letter explaining in detail why you urgently need the information. You need to sign the letter under penalty of perjury. Include the following words above your signature: \u201cThe information contained in this letter is complete, true, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d\n6. Pay a fee, if required. You typically won\u2019t have to pay a fee. You get the first 100 pages (and 2 hours of search time) free. Because your Form I-140 is not 100 pages, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything. However, you might have to pay a fee if you order in bulk.

The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

{"conversations":["What factors determine the maximum altitude for a plane?\nIs it limited by wing design, engine thrust, and so on?\nIs there a formula by which one can calculate the maximum altitude a plane can reach?","The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet \/ turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":196}

They play an important role in blocking ultraviolet (UV) radiation from being absorbed by the skin. UV radiation damages the skin and can lead to sunburns and skin cancer. This radiation is present all the time, even when the sun isn't shining. It's just that when the sun is shining the intensity of the radiation is much higher. You can still get sunburn on a cloudy day, it just takes longer.\nSunscreen works by absorbing or reflecting UV radiation before it penetrates the skin. You put it on before going out in the sun so it has time to work.

{"conversations":["Did two dissenting Supreme Court justices agree that Trump was \"absolutely immune\" to the Manhattan DA's subpoena?","If you are interested in the gory details, please see the full decision in Trump v. Vance. The first half of the linked document contains the Court's majority opinion and the concurring opinion of Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, followed by the separate dissenting opinions of Justices Thomas and Alito.\nBased on a quick read, it's apparent that Justice Thomas agrees with the general court's opinion that a sitting President &quot;is not entitled to absolute immunity from issuance of [a] subpoena&quot;. Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency \u2014 e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason \u2014 as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":33}

{"conversations":["This guy claims that Olympic powerlifters working in the 1-6 rep range can increase strength without increasing muscle size. \n\n> Trained Olympic lifters, for example, were shown over a two-year period to have significant strength increases with barely noticeable increases in muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size. Obviously, traditional strength training with low volume and low sets (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the best approach. Strength training does cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al, 1985), but it won't cause maximum hypertrophy.\n\nWhat is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true? That is, can a buff guy (with lots of prominent muscle) actually be weak? ","Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he\/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic\/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":39}
{"conversations":["How to find accounting telecommuting jobs?","## Account telecommuting tip\n\n1. Work in an office setting for a few years before starting to work from a home office. These years are not only valuable for experience, but they also allow you to build up a client base.\n2. Become part of a local professional network or volunteer organization. When you work from home, it is even more important to network with people in the business community. As a telecommuter, you will rely on contacts and referrals.\n3. Invest in organization and technology in your home office. Having fewer employees means that you will have to ensure your system is impeccably organized, automated and secure. Your ability to stay on top of projects is likely to have an effect on future jobs from repeat business. Other technology that you may want to look into is routing office calls to your cell phone, an Internet fax service, an online receipt scanner, like Shoe boxed, and video conferencing.\n4. Create a website for your business. You will need to invest in marketing in order to make your business appear legitimate to prospective clients, and get your name into the public. Keep the following information in mind when developing your website. Post reviews from current and former clients. This can help show potential clients the diverse types of accounting you can do. Advertise the advantages of using a home-based accountant. In general, home-based accountants charge approximately 70 percent less because they have less overhead. You may also be able to offer more flexible meeting times than office-based accountants and more personal attention. Link your website to your LinkedIn profile or a resume, so that clients can see what experience you have in the field and your certifications. Add on website plugins like an appointment scheduler and a contact form.\n\n\n## Find telecommuting job\n\n1. Ask your former or current clients for referrals. Although your clients may stay with an accounting firm if you leave it, the best way to look for jobs is to give out business cards and inquire with business professionals and former clients if they would give your name to anyone in need of accounting services.\n2. Reach out to your friends, family and contacts before tax season every year. Consider having a client appreciation party during the summer or holiday season, where clients are also encouraged to bring their friends. This will help you cement existing business relationships and perhaps find new ones.\n3. Register for online accounts with telecommuting job websites, such as Virtual Vocations or Freelanced. This site's job postings are dedicated to remote workers. You can post your resume for potential employers to see, and you can search by job date, location, travel requirements and employer when you need to look for work. You may also want to pay for a membership with FlexJobs, hea-employment.com. A membership will cost approximately $15 per month or $50 for a year. They also have a guarantee that you will find jobs.\n\t* \n\t* Comb the site ModernTelecommuter. Although this site is not fee based, it combs websites for telecommuting jobs, which can often be outdated. However, its aggregate function may save you time on your job hunt.\n4. Search on large job posting sites like CareerBuilder, Indeed or Monster. Make sure to tick the box that says \"Telecommute\" when searching on these sites. Also, keep in mind that there will be a large amount of competition for any posting, so you will need to apply quickly and often for jobs.\n5. Interview and list yourself with a local employment or staffing agency. Recruiters are always looking for professional contractors that may be able to fill positions with companies. Make sure to be clear about your desire to telecommute and your available time.\n6. Go directly to websites of large accounting firms and businesses. Review their job postings for telecommute positions. Although this takes a fair amount of research, it is becoming more common for businesses to hire remote, part-time workers to take on their accounts receivable and other bookkeeping tasks.\n7. Check back frequently on your local Craigslist site. A lot of part-time work is listed on this site. Businesses or individuals may be seeking an accountant, without having restrictions on where the work is done.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":717}

{"conversations":["How to identify a bandwagon fan?","Ever notice how people \"suddenly\" become fans of teams that are performing well? Do you ever wonder if they are \"real fans\" like they claim to be? Or do you wonder if they're just bandwagon fans? Bandwagon fans are defined as sports fans who have shown no past loyalty to a team, and who only support them when they are doing well. While people may not admit to being bandwagon fans, there are easy ways to spot them.\n\n## Listen to what they say\n\n1. See if they know the staff. True fans of a team will know the names of more than just the star player on the team. See if they know other players, coaches, owners, and former players. This will help determine if they have any loyalty towards the team. Knowing the play-makers is great. But a true fan needs to know more than the offensive players. They need to know what's going on on both sides of the ball. Not every fan follows what goes on behind the scenes so cut them some slack if they don't know the athletic trainer or the newest draft picks.\n2. Determine if they know statistics. Knowing statistics takes both time and effort. Do they know the average number of points scored per game? Do they know where the team ranks offensively and defensively? True fans always find ways to track the progress of their favorite team. Their knowledge should go beyond stats for the star player or the team's record. They should be able to discuss the teams status as if they were commentators for ESPN, because it is both informative and entertaining for real fans.\n3. See if they know any historical information about the team. It's easy to know about a team's current progress, but it's more difficult to know about the history of a team. A fan who has been loyal for years will know past players, championship years, and significant games. Many fans will also have personal stories associated with the team. For example, they'll know exactly where they were when the Houston Rockets won back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995. Many bandwagon fans only follow teams who have been successful over the last few years and will not know history that stretches beyond the team's current winning streak.\n4. Count how many teams they support. Fake fans usually divide their loyalty among more than one team. The more teams they support, the less of a true fan they are. Choosing a favorite sports team is like choosing a wife--you can only have one. In different sports, there are rules about teams you cannot support at the same time. For example, in baseball, you can't root for both the Yankees and the Mets. In football, you can't cheer for both the Texans and the Cowboys.\n5. Listen to their reasons for supporting the team. Most of the time loyalty to a team is determined by where you grew up or the player you idolized growing up. Bandwagon fans usually have flimsy excuses for why they support a team. For example, reasons such as liking the team logo, having a boyfriend or girlfriend that supports the team, or picking the team are not viable reasons. If your favorite team relocates to a different city then it is your choice to turn back on them or not. If you grew up in a city that didn't have a team for a specific sport, you're then able to pick a team (with good reason of course). If your team eventually gets a new franchise, it is your choice to stick with your current team, or start to follow the new one.\n6. See if they only support the best teams in the league. If the fan only supports the #1 teams in football, baseball, basketball, soccer or other major league sports, they are likely not supporting the team but supporting the winning streak. There will be times when your favorite team will consistently be successful, but it's a strange phenomenon when ALL of the teams you support are doing well. For example, it's perfectly acceptable to support the New England Patriots and their success. But to support them, the Boston Red Sox, the Golden State Warriors, and the Washington Capitals at the same time is a sign of being a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Watch what they do\n\n1. Notice if they go to games only when the team is successful. It's difficult to support a team when they are in a slump, but real fans do just that. Even if a real fan curses their team, they are there to support them the next game. Bandwagon fans jump off the wagon at the first sign of trouble. Going to a game takes more effort and more money. Bandwagon fans don't want to invest either if the team isn't doing well. The same is true of watching games on television.\n2. Ask why they leave the game early. True fans stay at a game until the bitter end--even if they know the result will be less than desirable. On the other hand, bandwagon fans tend to walk out and stop offering support to the team. Bandwagon fans often miss out on some of the best comebacks in sports because they choose to walk out during tough times. For example, in the 2013 NBA Finals in game six when the Miami Heat were down against the San Antonio Spurs, fans left early and missed out on a comeback. Also, in the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, they trailed so fans left the game early and missed out on an amazing onside kick recovery to eventually win the game and go to Super Bowl XLIX.\n3. Determine if they go to live games. If you don't cheer for the team in the area you grew up in, in favor of a team far away, that's one thing. But true fans still go to live sporting events for the experience of being around like-minded, passionate individuals. Bandwagon fans don't value the experience because they aren't as emotionally invested as real fans. Even if it means braving the cold or paying for over-priced beer, real fans will try to attend at least one game during the season. Some bandwagon fans will attend a game or two just to be able to say that they have. They are unlikely to attend games that aren't convenient. For example, when the weather is bad, when the tickets are too pricey, or when the game falls on a workday.\n4. See if they support the team only during playoffs. This has a bit to do with the team being successful, but it also has to do with the importance of the game. Regular seasons in sports tend to be long and grueling, so bandwagon fans like to skip the regular season games and jump right to the good part. Playoff games occur after the regular season and are tournament style games that lead up to the championship. Playoffs also bring out bandwagon fans whose \"first choice\" didn't make the playoffs. In order to have someone to root for, they will choose a team randomly and only for that season.\n5. Determine if they jump off the wagon. This is also known as wavering in their support of the team. If a fan stops supporting their team if they lose a playoff game, championship game, or don't make the playoffs at all, they're exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Identify a true fan\n\n1. See if they own a throwback jersey. A throwback jersey is one that duplicates a jersey worn by a team or player from the past. Real fans tend to purchase throwback jerseys (along side more modern sports gear) because they actually know the history of the team and its players. On the contrary, bandwagon fans typically purchase team gear that represents the more modern logos, colors, and players. True fans are also more likely to spend big bucks on team gear and throwbacks are usually more authentic and costly.\n2. Notice if they ever boo their team. True fans will never boo their team because they are trying to inspire them, not make them feel worse. It's okay to be angry with a less than perfect performance, but making your team feel like trash won't help. Real fans stick with their team for better or for worse.\n3. Determine if they support their team's players more than any others. A true fan's loyalty is always to his or her team first. That doesn't mean that they can't support or like other players, but it does mean that their loyalty lies with their team's players first. For example, it's fine to appreciate great players like Peyton Manning but if you're a New England Patriots fan you support Tom Brady first. Additionally, if you have players who are on your fantasy football team but are not on your favorite football team, you can support them only as far as it doesn't interfere with your favorite team's success.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":656}

The good cop isn't on the suspect's side, isn't trying to help the suspect, and knows full well the bad cop isn't ever going to hit, torture, or whatever the threat is. None of this is appropriate with your child.\n\nIt is advisory to give away any thoughts of an adversarial stance. You want your child to learn to be in control and not to tantrum. You want your child to comply with reasonable requests, whether that's putting on an item of clothing, helping to clean up, not hitting, or anything else. When your child can do those things, not only will you be happier but your child will too. You don't need to break their spirit, make them give up their resistance, force them to do what you want. You need to show them how to do the things everyone wants them to learn to do. Nobody is a bad cop in that. Nobody is a good cop. You can love your child while you're putting something out of their reach. You can smile and cuddle someone as part of letting them know they are not allowed to do a particular activity. You can be happy and cheerful while carrying a shoeless coatless child to the car (with their shoes and coat in your hands for later) and explaining there isn't time to play on the way now. \n\nWhatever these rules are, they should be the rules FOR everybody and BY everybody. If the toddler can't eat before dinner, nor can Daddy. If feet aren't allowed on the couch then that's the rule, not just \"if Mommy's looking.\" This kind of consistency isn't cruel or ganging up. You are showing your child the \"laws of physics\" of your home. This is how things go. Trying to understand mommy rules, daddy rules, sitter rules, grandparent rules - that's complicated! Remember, abiding by these rules isn't something mean or unfair, it's how life works in your house. And the toddler is trying to learn that. Make it as smooth as you can, and that includes being consistent, and not seeing the rules as mean.","I don't agree with this: \"Whatever these rules are, they should be the rules FOR everybody and BY everybody. If the toddler can't eat before dinner, nor can Daddy.\"\nChildren are children, not adults. They don't have the same rights and responsibilities as adults. If an adult tells a child they can't eat before dinner that doesn't mean the adult can't eat before dinner.\nChildren are not equals. Consistency of discipline is good. Trying to impose the same rules on children and adults is absurd.","It's neither wrong nor absurd. Sure, the rules can be different, but there must be an understandable, explainable reason for that (e.g. Daddy skipped lunch because of work). If the only reason you can give is \"because I say so and I can make you do what I want\" then you're basically teaching the child that might makes right and whoever has the power sets the rules. That's not something you want them to internalize. Obviously, this is probably beyond a toddler's understanding, but it's good to get into the habit early.","Well, I think it is perfectly reasonable to give \"because I say so\" as a reason to children. Adults do not need to explain themselves to children. If an adult says \"go to your room\" then the child should go to their room immediately. The child should not say \"why should I? you're not going to your room\". An instruction is an instruction, not a request.","While it's true that children should follow instructions from adults without questioning them, it's also beneficial to provide reasoning whenever possible. Giving children a basic understanding of why certain rules or actions are in place helps them develop critical thinking skills and a sense of fairness. While adults don't need to explain themselves every time, encouraging dialogue and providing age-appropriate explanations can foster a positive learning environment for children. Ultimately, finding a balance between clear expectations and reasonable explanations can promote mutual respect and understanding between parents and children."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1023}
{"conversations":["Assume that I am a programmer and I have an NP-complete problem that I need to solve it. What methods are available to deal with NPC problems? Is there a survey or something similar on this topic?","There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovi\u010d for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

{"conversations":["Why does PRC devalue its currency on purpose, but Turkey is worried about the devaluation of its currency?","Trade surplus\/deficit\nDevaluing one's currency means mostly one thing: It becomes more expensive to import products from abroad, while one's own products become comparably cheaper to buy on the world market. That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here. Turkey is actively inviting foreign investors, but China is quite reluctant to allow foreign economic influence in their country."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":12}

Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* less meat = less risk of death,\n* less meat for a longer time = an average of a 3 year longer lifespan + less risk of death,\n* after 90 years of no meat it stops decreasing your risk of death.\n\n\n> Conclusion: Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.\n\nSo yes, scientific research says that vegetarianism could help you live longer, but it primarily decreases your risk of death.

{"conversations":["How important is multithreading in the current software industry?","It is extremely important.\nWhat is more important though is to understand that multithreading is just one way to solve the asynchrony problem. The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":74}

What do I gain from rooting?","In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access.

It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion.

You, the tree outside and everything else made of carbon is right now undergoing continuous combustion. However, in the absence of catalyst, this process is too slow below a couple hundred degrees Celsius for it to be self-sustaining. More technically, combustion of organic matter is a highly exergonic process, but the activation energy is high. The meagre amount of heat generated by the handful of molecules reacting is too quickly diluted into the surroundings, and the reaction does not accelerate and spiral out of control (a fire, as described by the eternal Feynman).\n\nVery luckily for us, Life figured out this vast untapped source of chemical energy held back by kinetics approximately three billion years ago and developed a whole metabolic process to extract this energy in a stepwise fashion using catalysis, which we call aerobic respiration.

So, presuming we have directories ```\/mnt\/img\/one``` and ```\/mnt\/img\/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/two\n```\nIf you get an \"overlapping loop\" error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\n    -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\n```\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \nYou can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the ```-r``` (read-only) switch too.  If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the ```.img``` file.\nNote that the first partition is probably mounted on ```\/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":76}
{"conversations":["How to make a cat tree?","Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and\/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":658}
{"conversations":["How to dress for the gym?","When you go to the gym, it's important to wear clothes that are breathable and flexible. It's good to look good \u2013 but remember that fitness and safety are your foremost concerns. Ill-fitting clothing can cause itchy skin, rashes, or more serious injuries. Also, be mindful that your clothes may shift when you're working out. Wear clothing that will facilitate a solid workout.\n\n## Dress for women\n\n1. Choose a lightweight t-shirt or sweatshirt. Wear a breathable material like cotton or polyester. When you work out, you'll grow hot and sweaty, so you want to make sure that your clothing doesn't trap the heat. If possible, choose a top that is specifically designed for wicking sweat. Consider wearing a tank top or sports bra for a more breathable\u2014if more revealing\u2014outfit. If you have large breasts, then a sports bra may be essential for a comfortable gym experience. No matter your size, a bit of extra support never hurts.\n2. Pick your bottoms. Wear something flexible, with an elastic waistband: gym shorts, sweatpants, track pants, or yoga pants. You should be able to perform a full range of leg workouts while you're wearing the bottoms. The bottoms that you wear also depend on the effect that you're going for: tight and skin-showing clothing can help you show off, and baggier, more flowing garments might help you blend in. Short shorts may afford you the most flexibility, but they can also show a lot of skin. If you feel shy in shorts: wear sweats or yoga pants. If you wear shorts, inspect yourself from all angles in a mirror before you go to the gym. Keep in mind that people may be able to see up the leg of your shorts when you're using certain equipment, like the leg press.\n3. Bring appropriate footwear. The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs. Keep in mind that a lot of gyms don't allow open-toed shoes. If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much \u2013 just wear something comfortable that you can stand in. If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.\n\n\n## Dress for men\n\n1. Wear shorts or sweats. Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get. Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees \u2013 especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion. If you decide to wear shorts, be aware that other people may be able to see up the leg of your shorts when you're using machines like the leg press.\n2. Take a breathable, flexible shirt. A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion. A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for.\n3. Choose appropriate footwear. The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs. If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes.

If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.\n\n\n## General advice\n\n1. Wear lightweight, breathable socks. Cotton socks are generally a good choice. Make sure that the socks are neither too tight nor too loose! Wear high socks or low socks, to your taste. Short socks will give your legs more space to breathe, but high socks can be useful for wicking away sweat. Tight socks can constrict your legs and slow your blood circulation. On the other hand, socks that are too loose might distract you by sliding down your legs.\n2. Carry a towel. As you move about the gym, use a soft, clean towel to wipe your sweat away. You don't want to leave your sweat on the seat of a machine! Most gyms provide clean towels for members to use during their workouts. Do not share a towel with anyone, or else you risk sharing germs! Clean up any sweat that you do leave on a machine. Use a small, clean towel to wipe down the seat, the bars, and any other part that your sweat has touched. Your sweat carries bacteria that could infect someone else if left to dry on the machine!\n3. Wash your clothes after the gym. Even your own sweat, when left to dry on fabric, can breed nasty bacteria and then infect you. Odor-making bacteria tend to grow better on polyester than on cotton \u2013 but you should wash all gym clothes regardless.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":624}

{"conversations":["When learning vocabulary, especially with the use of SRS (Spaced Repetition System), it is interesting to use flashcards. A commonly encountered problem is how to formulate those for maximum efficiency.\nHow does learning vocabulary through sentences, thus giving context to the used words, compare to learning to recognize words alone? For example, the context may give away the meaning of the problematic vocabulary. Are there studies or expert opinions on one approach being preferable to the other at different stages of language learning?  Or is it recommended that they be mixed for best results?","It's usually best to avoid dichotomies like \"Is strategy X better or strategy Y better?\". In most cases, strategies are not mutually exclusive but complementary. \n\nWith vocabulary learning, using just one strategy is probably the least efficient. This is because every strategy has certain strengths (certain skills it builds well) and certain weaknesses (skills it doesn't cover well)- and if you keep using one strategy, you'll be only focusing on the strengths (but with diminishing returns), and not addressing the weaknesses.\n\nUsing flashcards helps you establish word-to-meaning equivalences quickly, but it usually does so with a shallow meaning, ignoring the breadth of meaning that words usually have. It also ignores the contextual subtleties of the word, and the knowledge is not always retained long-term. \n\nIt's best to combine flashcards with other strategies that will help you see how the word is used in context, show you the variety of meanings it can have (and doesn't have), see what collocations the word has, etc. One way of doing this is by reading examples of the word and writing your own sample sentences.

{"conversations":["How to lighten up your bikini areas?","For all kinds of reasons, some people develop pigmentation in the bikini areas. However, it doesn't have to be a permanent issue. There are a variety of effective, lasting ways to address it. By safely lightening these regions, your skin can have a beautiful, even tone in the bikini areas once again.\n\n## Lighten the bikini areas with home remedy\n\n1. Use Papaya Soap. Papaya soap is natural and using it regularly will help to lighten the skin. Use it at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, until you see results. Keep your skin moisturized because it can dry out your skin. You can also mash up a chunk of ripe papaya, and apply a big dollop on the areas. Leave it on for 30 minutes and then wash it off. In a couple of week's time, you should see significant lightening.\n2. Apply glycolic or salicylic acid acne pads. These two ingredients are the lightening agents used for acne treatments and can also be used for this purpose. Dab a pad on the areas and then get into the shower. Let the steam sink in for a couple minutes and wash off. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n3. Use a lemon juice, yogurt mix. Mix juice from 1\/4 lemon into a tablespoon of yogurt, and apply to the area. It acts as a mild bleaching solution that will safely lighten it. Apply aloe vera gel afterwards to keep your skin moist and hydrated. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n4. Apply almond paste. Soak several almonds for 24 hours. Then slide the skins off, and add a couple drops of milk to make a paste. Put on the bikini areas, and leave on for an hour. Wash off with warm water. If used regularly, it works as a mild lightener and also exfoliates and softens the skin.\n5. Try using milk to lighten and moisturize your skin. Pour some milk into a bowl and dip into with a cotton ball. Dab onto your skin. Milk is a natural skin lightener, and it also won't dry it out. It's not going to happen overnight but with regular use, you will see some slight results.\n6. Apply peroxide onto the area. Wipe off after 15 minutes. Do this a couple of times a day until you see results. Peroxide is highly acidic, so you may want to apply a little almond or coconut oil on the area after washing it off. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n\n\n## Go to a dermatologist to correct the problem\n\n1. Ask the doctor about using a skin bleaching cream containing hydroquinone. This kind of cream works by preventing melanin from being produced in the skin. It's one of the most popular lightening treatments. However, if the concentration is too high or if it's used for too long, it could worsen the discoloration or reverse the effects. It can also be toxic to the liver.\n2. Talk to your dermatologist about a milder skin bleaching treatment. Some alternative, fading creams that are known to have less side effects are azelaic acid, kojic acid and one containing only 2 percent hydroquinone. All of these are known to help with persistent or residual skin discoloration problems. They work by preventing keratin, a hair protein, from being produced in the skin.\n3. Find out from your doctor if you're a good candidate for using a bleaching agent, such as chlorine, to lighten the areas. This is a mix formulated by the medical professional doing the treatment. Due to the concentration of bleach, dermatologists and medical doctors are the only ones allowed to administer it.\n4. Opt for laser hair removal. If the darkening is caused by waxing, shaving, and\/or you can see dark hair stubble as it's growing back, then laser hair removal may be a good solution for you. Though it's considered semi-permanent, the hair usually doesn't come back. However, you have to make sure to complete the recommended number of treatments and the ongoing, but infrequent, touch-ups.\n\n\n## Prevent darken of the bikini areas\n\n1. Exfoliate the area. Old skin cells don't just build up on your knees and elbows but on other areas of the skin as well. When they accumulate, they can make the skin appear darker and duller. Prior to shaving, lightly exfoliate the region using a loofah, scrub or exfoliating brush. This will remove the dry skin and will also help to prevent skin irritation and ingrown hairs in the bikini areas.\n2. Use sunblock. When going in the sun, use a sunblock to keep the sun from penetrating those areas of your skin that you don't want getting darker. Choose a sunblock with a high SPF number (Sun Protection Factor) such as SPF 45 on that region. Also when you come out of the sun, apply olive oil to the area, as it's also known to be a natural skin lightener.\n3. Wear breathable, cotton clothing that is loose and comfortable. Sweating in the bikini areas are known to cause darkening. Avoid polyester clothing and other synthetic fabrics, as they don't allow the skin to breath. Also tight clothing sometimes causes chafing and could also darken these areas.\n4. Use a quality razor, and shave gently in the direction of the hair growth. If shaving irritates the skin, it could darken it. Basically, dark spots are caused by constant friction. If you shave every day, your skin attempts to protect it so it darkens up. Any type of injury to your skin will either create a stain or keloid. Waxing can also cause darkening if it's too hot.\n5. Eat more vegetables and fruits. Fruits, oranges and berries, in particular, and green, leafy vegetables have lots of antioxidants that assist in reducing discoloration of the skin. Drinking water also helps to flush toxins out of the body.\n6. Drink more water. It is one of the best ways to detoxify. There is no one-size-fits-all to how much water a person should drink. As a general rule, though, women should drink 128 ounces a day, and men should consume 128 ounces of water a day.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":641}

Therefore, any prohibition of the letter \u00c6 (or \u00e6) etc. would have to come from the administrative interpretation of California Department of Public Health, Vital Records.

The rule might be challenged in court as exceeding statutory authority, and might well be deemed to discriminate w.r.t. race and national origin. The rule could be defended on grounds of necessity, if we presume that the department is incapable of recording information other than the 26 letters and \"appropriate punctuation\" (undefined, presumably only apostrophe). It's not that in principle Unicode doesn't exist, it's that their system may not be capable of dealing with it (numerous problems would arise from the non-unique mapping from visual representation to Unicode number).

{"conversations":["How to hook up with an ex girlfriend?","## Get ready to hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Keep it spontaneous. If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up. If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.\n2. Let enough time pass. If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated. Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her. Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.\n3. Let her know you want to hook up. Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too. Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot. Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.\n4. Make your intentions clear. Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up. Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.\n5. Make sure you're on the same page. Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it. Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more? Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two. Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?\n\n\n## Hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Make sure you only hook up. Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her. Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.\n2. Hook up sparingly. Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week. Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?\n3. Don't get too comfortable. It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable. No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.\n4. Stay in control. If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free. This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.\n5. Keep your new relationship private. Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you. If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship. If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.\n6. Avoid \"lovey dovey\" stuff when you're hooking up. Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, \"He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,\" or \"He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.\" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her. You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.\n\n\n## Know when to stop hook up\n\n1. Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again. Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings. If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave. If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out. If you have to end the \"relationship\" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.\n2. Stop if one of you starts liking someone else. If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings. If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time. If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.\n3. Stop when you've fallen into a routine. Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over. You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.\n4. Stop if you start fighting like a couple. As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, \"Where is this taking us?\" or \"What does all of this mean?\" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right? It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.\n5. Stop if you're no longer having fun. The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended. Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":700}
{"conversations":["What does ```class``` do in Ruby?","First, the ```class``` syntax opens up ```foo```'s singleton class (eigenclass). This allows you to specialise the behaviour of methods called on that specific object.\n```a = 'foo'\nclass << a\n  def inspect\n    '\"bar\"'\n  end\nend\na.inspect   # => \"bar\"\na = 'foo'   # new object, new singleton class\na.inspect   # => \"foo\"\n```\n\nNow, to answer the question: ```class``` opens up ```self```'s singleton class, so that methods can be redefined for the current ```self``` object (which inside a class or module body is the class or module itself). Usually, this is used to define class\/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```. So, each time a caller calls the ```process``` method (which calls the redefinable ```process_hook```), the behaviour changes depending on what state it's in."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":363}
{"conversations":["How to make the most of your physical therapy?","## Physical therapy payments\n\n1. Ask your doctor to recommend the best physical therapist for your condition. Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.\n2. Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered. Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.\n3. Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket. Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.\n\n\n## Physical therapy sessions\n\n1. Have a positive attitude toward physical therapy. Will power and optimism during a recovery are almost as important as doctor's care. Your commitment to the exercises will have a direct correlation to the swiftness and completeness of your recovery.\n2. Wear athletic shoes and loose-fitting, flexible clothing to all physical therapy sessions. If you have to go to your session straight from work, then keep spare exercise clothing in your bag or car. This type of clothing allows you the full range of motion in your exercises and keeps your regular clothes clear of analgesic creams or massage oils.\n3. Drink plenty of water while you are exercising. Although this is a general rule, it is even more important when you are healing from an injury. Stay hydrated throughout the day and bring a water bottle to your session.\n4. Show up early to each appointment. Your physical therapist may allow you to warm up before the session, on a machine or by stretching. This also makes certain that you are never late, because you will be charged for the session from the moment your appointment time arrives. Make sure to be 15 minutes early for your first appointment. You will need to fill out insurance and health forms. Bring a list of your medications and other current treatments.\n5. Discuss your goals with your physical therapist at your first meeting. Pain and injury are different for everyone, so you must make it clear whether you want to return to work, get rid of pain, walk without weight supports or run a marathon. Tell the physical therapist how many sessions you can afford, so the plan can be adjusted for what you will do during your sessions and what you can continue at home. Remember that this may need to be adjusted on the future, based on your progress. In most cases, the harder you work doing prescribed exercises at home, the fewer office sessions you will need to have.\n6. Ask your physical therapist to give you a list of prescribed exercises, with diagrams. They should establish what and when you should be doing each exercise, so that you are clear about your \"homework.\" Ask the physical therapist to show you each exercise as well as having you do repetitions in the office.\n7. Tell your physical therapist whenever something is painful. Mistakes can be made if you do not communicate properly about your pain levels. The physical therapist can also tell you what pain is natural to the healing process and what is unnatural, allowing the exercises to be adjusted.\n8. Ask to be treated by the same physical therapist every time. This provides consistency, familiarity and a greater chance that you will be able to accomplish your goals.\n9. Ask plenty of questions. You must be proactive about your treatment. If you don't understand why you are doing something or how you should do something, you are more likely to refrain from the exercise and fail to progress.\n10. Report your progress at the beginning of each physical therapy session. Make sure you tell your therapist any new pain or problems, as well as your positive progress. They will usually write this on your chart to ensure you won't have complications from the regime.\n11. Leave your cell phone and personal problems at the door when you go to physical therapy. You must use this valuable time to focus on health and your body. You may need to learn to recognize your body's warning signs, which is hard to do when you are distracted.\n\n\n## Physical therapy at home\n\n1. Create a schedule to do your physical therapy exercises at home. Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.\n2. Set aside a space to do physical therapy. Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.\n3. Take the prescribed therapy exercises seriously. If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.\n4. Progress to more repetitions or sets as you get stronger. Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.\n5. Ask the physical therapist for an appropriate regimen to continue after you no longer attend sessions. They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":705}
{"conversations":["So whenever we want to shoot our flash before taking a photo. we have to charge it first.\nWhat is the point of the charging our flashes? Aren't their power directly supplied by the battery of our camera?\nPlease answer for the built in flash on the 2000D and the traditional hot shoe Xenon flashes.\nPerhaps these hot shoe xenon flashes have their own batteries charged by the slow hot shoe port. Who knows? ","The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1\/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":54}

But you also have to become aware of your posture and find a way to interrupt prolonged sitting intervals with brief breaks.  A good ergonomic chair is also helpful.\n\n## Musculo-Skeletal Effects of Poor Sitting Posture\n\nPoor sitting posture can create muscle imbalances over time.\n\n* In general, your front stuctures shorten, with muscles like your hip flexors and pectorals tightening up - pulling you into a ball.  Your crunched sitting posture caves your lower ribs down towards your abdomen which prevents the diaphragm from expanding freely. \n* At the same time the muscles of your back stretch out and weaken, especially in the range where they should be working to maintain your posture.\n\nAs this posture persists over time, you joints begin to lose normal range of motion as well making it more difficult to assume a good posture.\n\n\n## Correcting Slumped Sitting Posture\nTailor an exercise program to stretch tightened muscles and strengthen weakened muscles.  Additionally, you need a method to become aware of your posture and correct it while you are sitting.  This is difficult because as you say, your attention is on your work. Exercise programs like Yoga, Tai-Chi and Pilates are good because they all address and make you very aware of your posture, joint alignments, flexibility, core control and breathing.\n\nUse Specific Exercises to Correct Muscle Imbalances:\n\n* Back, Upper Back and Scapular muscles:  Back Extensions strengthen your paraspinals.  Use different arm positions (Y, T, W, L) to target your lower traps, mid traps, rhomboids and scapular stabilizors.  Learn the feel of retracting your scapulas.\nYou can do these on the floor next to your desk. \nOr if you prefer not to get on the floor, use resistance bands for reverse flys, wide rows, narrow rows and rotations. \nAway from work, you can also strengthen these muscles using weights, cables and body weight exercises like inverted rows, cable rows, bent over rows, reverse flys etc.  And squats are a good for strengthening multiple muscles important to posture.\n* Core:  Plank, Side Plank, Bird Dog and Bridge will stabilize your trunk and spine.\n* Stretches: - Hip Flexors, Hamstrings, Abs and Pecs.  The wall pec stretch stretches the pecs but also contracts the rhomboid and trapezius scapular muscles to help improve the positioning of the shoulder and shoulder blade and is easy to do at work. \n* Sitting Posture and Breathing Awareness - This sitting posture exercise helps make you aware of your sitting alignment and expanding your diaphragm.  Practice a few diaphramatic breaths throughout the day along with this sitting exercise to elongate your spine.\n\nCreate your ideal short exercise routine that you can do during short breaks during the day. An exercise ball next to your desk can help you target these muscles in just a few minutes:\n\n* Lie back over the ball and stretch out your front \n* Lie face down over the ball and do the Y, W, T, L exercises.\nAnd consider using the ball as your desk chair for short periods.\n\n## Remembering your Posture throughout the day:\n\nThis is the hard part.  As your muscle imbalances begin to resolve and your diaphragmatic breathing improves, you\u2019ll find that the slouched posture becomes less comfortable and you will automatically begin to sit better.  Until then, use a timed reminder or try tying your posture corrections to tasks that you do at the computer regularly.  For example, correct your posture each time you check your email or some other specific link.  Turn on your web cam for visual reminders.\n\nKeep at it until you feel the improvement.

{"conversations":["In Python specifically, how do variables get shared between threads?\nAlthough I have used ```threading.Thread``` before I never really understood or saw examples of how variables got shared.  Are they shared between the main thread and the children or only among the children? When would I need to use thread local storage to avoid this sharing?\nI have seen many warnings about synchronizing access to shared data among threads by using locks but I have yet to see a really good example of the problem. \nThanks in advance!","In Python, everything is shared, except for function-local variables (because each function call gets its own set of locals, and threads are always separate function calls.) And even then, only the variables themselves (the names that refer to objects) are local to the function; objects themselves are always global, and anything can refer to them. The `Thread` object for a particular thread is not a special object in this regard. If you store the `Thread` object somewhere all threads can access (like a global variable) then all threads can access that one Thread object. If you want to atomically modify anything that another thread has access to, you have to protect it with a lock. And all threads must of course share this very same lock, or it wouldn't be very effective.\n\nIf you want actual thread-local storage, that's where `threading.local` comes in. Attributes of `threading.local` are not shared between threads; each thread sees only the attributes it itself placed in there.

{"conversations":["How to prepare for a vaginoplasty?","A vaginoplasty is a surgical procedure that reconstructs or tightens the outer and inner muscles of your vagina, which can become weak and loose over time. It may improve your comfort levels and symptoms of incontinence. Some even claim it can boost sexual pleasure though this is not well studied and highly individual. A vaginoplasty can also create a vagina if you're undergoing gender-affirming surgery. You can prepare for a vaginoplasty by visiting your doctor, arranging your surgery, planning your recovery, and following pre-op requirements. For gender affirming surgery, you'll work with your doctor to prepare for surgery.\n\n## Visit your doctor\n\n1. Talk to your doctor about the procedure. Your doctor can fully explain the procedure, as well as what you can expect afterward. They'll also discuss the risks of the surgery. Tell your doctor why you want the surgery so that they can help you avoid disappointment. The doctor will ask about your health and well-being before approving you for the procedure. Bring a detailed medical history, including conditions you're being treated for. Tell the doctor if you're seeing a therapist. If you're undergoing treatment for a condition related to your decision to get a vaginoplasty, such as body image issues, it's best to tell the doctor. Provide the doctor with a list of any medications you're taking, including the dosage amounts. Ask about your needs post-surgery. This includes what you should expect at the hospital and during the days after the surgery.\n2. Get a blood test. Your doctor will want to do a few simple tests to make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. First, they'll do a simple blood test, which is virtually painless. This lets them check your hemoglobin and health profile to ensure that you are healthy. They may also do a pregnancy test, as you won't be able to get a vaginoplasty if you're pregnant.\n3. Undergo a urine test. The doctor will also do a urinalysis to make sure that you're healthy. This is a simple, painless test. You'll just need to urinate in a cup, and the medical staff will take care of the rest!\n4. Confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't want more kids. You should not get a vaginoplasty if you want to have more children or if you're pregnant. In this case, it's best for you to wait until you're finished having children. Your doctor will likely ask you to confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't plan to become pregnant. The doctor may also choose to do a pregnancy test before allowing you to get the surgery.\n\n\n## Arrange your surgery\n\n1. Contact your insurance provider to check your coverage. Many insurance companies won't cover a vaginoplasty, as it's usually considered an elective procedure. This means you may have to pay for it out of pocket. If you're not sure you can afford the procedure, ask your doctor if they offer a payment plan. You can also look into CareCredit, a line of credit opened specifically for elective medical procedures. CareCredit requires an application similar to that of most credit cards.\n2. Make a budget for how you'll pay for the procedure. Factor in the cost of the procedure, your pre-op and follow-up appointments, pharmacy costs, and the time you'll need to take off work. Determine where you'll get the money, such as from savings or by borrowing. Some of your appointments could be covered by insurance, so you may not need to pay these out of pocket. In the United States, a vaginoplasty typically costs between $4,500 and $8,500.\n3. Plan the surgery in between menstrual periods if applicable. You cannot get a vaginoplasty while you're on your period. The best time to have the surgery is right after your period, which allows you as much recovery time as possible before your next period starts.\n4. Take photos of your genitals before the surgery. Your doctor may also want a set of photos. This allows you and your doctor to see the difference before and after your surgery.\n5. Make your surgical appointment. It usually takes several months to a year from your initial consultation to get your surgery. You should find out your surgery date about 2-3 months before it will occur. Your doctor can provide you more information about your unique case.\n\n\n## Plan your recovery\n\n1. Schedule time off of work. You'll need at least a few days to recover, but how long you should take off depends on your job demands. It's a good idea to request at least a calendar week. If your job is very physically demanding, you may want to take off longer. Ask your doctor how long you should take off. If you'll lose part of your income, make a special budget to help you cover your living costs.\n2. Ask someone to come help you. You'll need help as soon as your surgery is over. Someone will need to drive you home and help you take care of your needs. This includes getting any additional medications, preparing meals, helping care for pets, and completing household chores. It's best to arrange this help ahead of time. If possible, recruit a few friends or loved ones to act as a support system following your surgery. You can also hire a professional home-care nurse to help you in the days following your procedure.\n3. Create a pain treatment plan to make your recovery easier. It's normal to experience some pain after surgery, but luckily it's possible to minimize it. Planning beforehand can make it easier to treat your pain so that your recovery goes as smoothly and as painlessly as possible. Discuss pain medicine with your doctor. Obtain an over-the-counter pain reliever, if recommended. Ask your doctor if a prescription pain reliever might be right for you. You could also purchase a heating pad or single-use heat packs to help manage your pain.\n4. Stock your fridge and freezer with healthy, easy to prepare meals. Cooking will be hard following surgery, so it's a good idea to have lots of easy options at home. You could make meals ahead of time or use commercial microwaveable dinners. Alternatively, you could have someone cook for you, if this is an option.\n5. Plan mood boosters for your downtime. After your surgery, you'll need to take a break from regular life for a few days. Gather a few activities to occupy your mind during this time, like a book, coloring book, or favorite TV show. It's a good idea to collect a few easy-to-access options so that it's easier to keep your mood up while you recover. Check out a few new releases from the library. Get an adult coloring book or download a coloring app. Add a new comedy to your watchlist on your favorite streaming site. Place your iPad and other devices, including chargers, near your recovery area for easy access.\n6. Purchase menstruation pads if you're still menstruating. You won't be able to use a tampon or menstrual cup for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Menstruation pads are an easy alternative while you're in recovery. Ask your doctor before you resume using tampons or a menstrual cup. Your muscles must be healed before these methods are an option for you.\n7. Talk to your partner about sex after the surgery. You'll need to avoid sex for 4-6 weeks while your vagina heals. Make sure your partner understands this wait, and discuss ways you two can be intimate without having sex. Visit your doctor for a check-up before you engage in sexual activity. The doctor needs to examine your vagina and clear you for sex.\n\n\n## Follow pre-op recommendations\n\n1. Stop taking aspirin and blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery. All surgeries increase your bleeding risk. Blood thinners can further increase this risk by making it harder for your blood to clot. Over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen pain relievers can thin your blood, so you shouldn't take them before your surgery. You may also need to stop taking vitamins and supplements. Tell your doctor what you're taking so that they can advise you. If you are taking a prescription blood thinner, talk to your doctor about when you should decrease your dosage. Don't stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.\n2. Avoid smoking in the weeks before your surgery. Smoking can slow your recovery time. This is because it narrows your veins and makes it harder for blood to flow. This means that your blood isn't able to effectively deliver oxygen throughout your body, which is necessary during recovery. Your doctor may decide to check your urine to make sure that you have quit. It's best to stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to having your surgery.\n3. Shave your genital area before surgery. This makes it easier for the doctor to complete the procedure. It can also reduce your chance of infection. If you don't shave the area beforehand, the medical team may do it prior to beginning your operation.\n4. Follow your pre-op procedures. The doctor will instruct you on what to do in the days leading up to the surgery. The day before surgery, you may be instructed to fast. It's best to eat a hearty breakfast that morning, as the rest of the day you may only be allowed clear liquids. Your pre-op plan may also include the following:\n\t* A bowel cleanse\n\t* Fasting, with clear liquids\n\t* Drinking more than 8 glasses of water\n\t* Rest\n\t* Nothing ingested by mouth after the midnight prior to surgery\n5. Do relaxation techniques to cope with stress or worry. It's normal to worry before undergoing surgery. It's a good idea to spend some time relaxing the night before the surgery. Perform deep breathing exercises. Meditate. Stretch or do yoga. Color in an adult coloring book or app. Go for a walk outdoors if the weather is nice. Soak in a warm bath.\n6. Plan for an overnight stay at the hospital. You may be able to leave the hospital a few hours after your surgery, but many doctors will hold you overnight. Pack an overnight bag with a change of clothes, a light robe, slippers, and any toiletries you think you may need.\n\n\n## Prepare for gender affirm surgery\n\n1. Discuss the risks and options. Gender-affirming surgery is not right for everyone. It can be expensive and is irreversible. Your doctor and a therapist can help you decide if the benefits of getting gender affirming surgery outweigh the risks in your case. A therapist will determine if you're mentally healthy enough to undergo the procedure. They'll also consider how long you've wanted to get the procedure. Before you're approved, you'll have to show that you've been living as a woman for at least a year, including taking appropriate hormones.\n2. Obtain two letters of support from qualified mental health professionals. Each letter must be written by a mental health professional who is experienced in working with transgender individuals. You can search online for a qualified therapist near you using a site like Psychology Today. The letters should confirm the following:\n\t* Your gender identification is persistent and well-documented\n\t* You're competent to choose the surgery and consent to treatment\n\t* You're of legal age\n\t* You're being treated for any mental health conditions\n\t* You've been undergoing hormone treatment\n3. Plan to take extra time off work. It usually takes about 2 months to fully recover from gender-affirming surgery. At the very least, you'll need to stay home for the week after surgery. If you must go back after that week, however, it's best to arrange a lighter workload. If it's possible, ask your boss if you can have a flexible schedule or work from home. If you work a field job, ask for desk duty for a few weeks. You could also try working part-time. Check with your doctor before going back to work.\n4. Ask your doctor when you should stop taking your hormones. You'll need to stop taking your hormones before you can undergo the surgery. Each surgeon will make their own recommendation. In general, you can expect to stop taking them about 3 weeks before your surgery.\n5. Talk to your partner about sex post-surgery. After gender affirming surgery, it will likely take 2 months to fully recover. You will need to avoid sex during this time. You can still be intimate in other ways, and it's a good idea to explore those options before your surgery.\n6. Remove the hair from your genital area. Check with your surgeon to find out what this will entail. For some, it may just mean shaving your genital area. However, some surgeons require you to get electrolysis hair removal prior to getting gender-affirming surgery.\n7. Expect to be in the hospital for about 5-7 days. Your doctor will likely admit you to the hospital a day or 2 before your surgery. You'll then need to remain in the hospital after your surgery for at least 3 nights. However, the entire length of your stay can vary. It's a good idea to ask your doctor what the average hospital stay is for their patients. In the days after your surgery, you'll likely experience some pain and discomfort in your vagina. The doctor can help manage your pain as you heal.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":720}

Everything heated to a proper internal temperature (depends on the dish, check the USDA's site for guidelines), no sampling the raw chicken dish, etc.\n* For fruits and veg, if you can't peel it, don't eat it. A tremendous number of GI outbreaks are due to fruit and veg, rather than meat. This includes things like salads - since you can't really peel lettuce, avoid it.\n* Check if the local water is safe. When in doubt, assume it isn't. You can stick to bottled water, though there's always the distinct chance its being bottled from a contaminated source. Coke\/Pepsi etc., and beer are good alternatives. Little known fact, the Coca-Cola company is hugely involved in clean water programs worldwide, because they need it for their product.\n* Ice.

{"conversations":["Is it more important to prioritize economic growth and development, or to preserve the natural environment and protect our planet for future generations?","The most important thing to remember here is that the two are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse."],"source":"authors","idx":542}
{"conversations":["How to promote your business on tiktok?","For most people, TikTok is a fun way to kill time and share zany videos with friends. In the right hands, however, it can also be a useful promotional tool. Taking advantage of the app\u2019s unique format can help business owners get more eyes on their products and services, especially if they\u2019re aimed at a younger target audience.\n\n## Establish a presence\n\n1. Create an official TikTok account for your business. When you open the app for the first time, you\u2019ll be given the option to sign up using your phone number, email address, or a third-party platform like Facebook. Once you\u2019ve successfully created an account, tap the person-shaped icon in the lower righthand corner and hit \u201cEdit Profile\u201d to access your user settings. There, you can change your name, write out a custom bio, and upload a profile picture or video.You\u2019ll find TikTok listed near the top of the \u201cMost Downloaded\u201d section of your preferred app store.\n2. Build a profile that represents your business well. Start by choosing a distinctive profile picture that will make your account instantly identifiable. A logo, mascot, or photo of one of your products will work best in most cases. Then, draft a short bio that explains who you are, what you do, and why your followers should be interested.Be sure to include a link to your website or online store in your bio. That way, users will be able to find out more about your business just by visiting your profile.Tip: Asking yourself questions like, \u201cWho is my target audience?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I hoping to show my followers?\u201d, and, \u201cHow does this app fit in with my other marketing strategies?\u201d while you\u2019re tinkering with your profile can help you zero in a more effective presentation.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the app\u2019s basic format. While it offers a host of different features, TikTok is primarily a video sharing platform that lets users upload video clips up to 15 seconds in length. This rapid-fire setup forces content creators to find imaginative ways to capture their viewers\u2019 attention and make a statement fast.Users also have the option of setting their videos to popular songs and sound clips in order to make playful lip syncing videos, produce mini music videos, or just add a little extra style. If you have a longer video that you want to show, it\u2019s also possible to connect multiple segments that will play continuously for up to 60 seconds.\n4. Take advantage of the app\u2019s built-in editing features when posting videos. When you\u2019re ready to get creating, tap the \u201c+\u201d button in the bottom center of the screen. This will pull up the in-app camera, allowing you to shoot a video that\u2019s anywhere between 15 and 60 seconds in length. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have the option to trim your video, add stylish transitions, write custom captions, and layer on filters and other special effects.One of TikTok\u2019s most beloved features is the ability to add backing music and sound clips. Tap on the \u201cMusic\u201d icon in your editing dashboard to browse an absolutely massive library of hit songs from all eras. You can also hit the \u201cUpload\u201d icon to the right of the red \u201cRecord\u201d button to upload a video that you shot on your device earlier. This feature can be handy in those situations where you want to prepare a new post but don\u2019t have a lot of time to play around on the app.\n\n\n## Produce effective content\n\n1. Focus on putting together videos that are fun and engaging. TikTok is an unconventional app, so it\u2019s no place for conventional advertising. Spend some time coming up with ideas for posts that you think will pique your audience\u2019s interest, make them laugh, or encourage them to try out your product or service for themselves. The ultimate goal is for your brand to stick in their memory.Viral dance videos are all the rage on TikTok, so if you\u2019ve got some sweet moves up your sleeve, now\u2019s the time to show the world. Use this opportunity to get creative and think outside the advertising box\u2014crack jokes, incorporate chart-topping songs, or work in clever pop culture references that will help you gain traction with your audience. Anything goes!\n2. Make sure your content comes across as genuine. While there\u2019s a virtually unlimited number of ways to express your business\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d on TikTok, it\u2019s crucial that your content have a casual, down-to-earth feel to it. If it seems forced or insincere, your audience won\u2019t buy it\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re trying to get them to do.Old-fashioned ads rarely get a second look these days. But if you can highlight the exciting, adventurous, or playful aspects of your business in a way that makes users feel like they\u2019re a part of something, it\u2019s sure to get them talking. The kind of people who value the app\u2019s open-ended, creative format are notoriously hard to sway using traditional marketing strategies, and tend to appreciate businesses that seem relatable and take more of a down-to-earth approach.Tip: Forget about polished, overly formal sales pitches. TikTok culture is all about fun, spontaneity, and accessibility, with a strong \"DIY\" aesthetic.\n3. Create short product demonstrations. Make videos of yourself or your team members actually using the items you\u2019re advertising. This is a good chance to show your viewers just what your products can do, or to highlight any key features or intended uses it might have.A video of someone sipping an ice cold soft drink on the beach surrounded by friends, for instance, will be much more likely to make an impression on viewers than one showing someone drinking the same beverage alone in their kitchen. Remember, you only have 15 seconds, so you\u2019ll need to either edit together a montage of quick cuts or skip to the most impressive part of your demonstration in order to get your message across.\n4. Start a viral hashtag challenge. Come up with a unique way to get your audience to engage with a particular product or service, give it a catchy hashtag, and offer to share or repost select submissions from users who add the hashtag to their posts. Not only will this give them a chance to gain some exposure by being featured on your account, it will also ensure that your hashtag is spread far and wide.Imagine that you run a footwear company called Swiftz. You might challenge TikTok users to post videos of themselves wearing your shoes for their favorite activities with the hashtag, \u201c#SwiftzTakesMe.\u201d\n5. Encourage users to interact with your posts. Whenever you put up a new post, include a call-to-action to motivate viewers to like, comment, and share. Doing so will let them establish a kind of dialogue with your company, increasing its visibility in the process. On an app like TikTok, greater visibility means greater discoverability, which in turn means more customers.Prompts like, \u201cTell us which feature of our new jeans you like best in the comments!\u201d or, \u201cWhat other uses have you discovered for our infinitely-customizable storage cubes?\u201d give your audience a chance to take a more active role in your branding efforts. Another way to expand your reach is to ask viewers to post videos of themselves using your product or explaining what they like about it for a shot at a repost, similar to hashtag challenge.\n\n\n## Buy ad space on tiktok\n\n1. Publish in-feed native content. In-feed native ads are video ads that pop up periodically between regular user videos. When you post one of these ads, it will appear as a full-screen, skippable video, similar to branded stories on Instagram. This is the most straightforward way to advertise on TikTok, and probably the one that promises the most visibility overall.If you\u2019re interested in making use of TikTok\u2019s ad service, you\u2019ll need to work with one of the company\u2019s marketing reps, who will provide you with all the info you need regarding pricing, structure, and targeting. Once your ad has been posted, you can track its outreach by reviewing a number of different metrics, including clicks, views, play duration, and interactions like comments and shares.Tip: While building your ad, you\u2019ll have the option of including links to your website, online store, or app, as well as hashtags that users can click on to see similar content.\n2. Stage a brand takeover. Brand takeovers are large-scale social media marketing campaigns that allow brands to \u201ctake over\u201d an app for a single day. What this means is that your business\u2019s branding elements will be displayed on the app\u2019s home screen for 24 hours. During that time, you can also use the app\u2019s creative features to mass-distribute targeted content containing clickable hashtags and embedded links to your website or product pages.For more information on pricing and availability, get in touch with a TikTok marketing rep by visiting the Advertising section of the company\u2019s website. There are also \u201cTop View\u201d takeover packages available that transition directly into 15-second in-feed video ads from the home screen.\n3. Pay for promoted hashtags. Promoted hashtags essentially accomplish the same thing as homegrown hashtag challenges. The main difference is that instead of relying on your audience to spread word of your challenge, TikTok will market it for you through targeted posts. Needless to say, it has the potential to find its way around to a lot more users this way.Having TikTok share your business\u2019s hashtags can seriously increase your web traffic, but it definitely isn\u2019t cheap. By some estimates, purchasing a promoted hashtag could run you as much as $150,000!\n4. Apply for your own branded lenses. Lenses are editing features that enable TikTok users to enhance their images and videos by adding special effects, much like the filters on Snapchat and Instagram. Users who try out your lenses will be sending a subtle message to their followers to check out your business. The more people you can get using your lenses, the more name recognition you stand to earn yourself.If you opt to go this route, you\u2019ll work closely with TikTok\u2019s marketing experts to develop lenses based on some aspect of your business\u2019s branding. Ideally, your lenses should offer users a cool new effect or look to play around with, not just plaster your name or logo everywhere. Don\u2019t forget that your objective is to actually get people to use it.\n5. Work with well-known influencers to grow your audience faster. One of the best ways to generate a buzz when you\u2019re just starting out is to collaborate with users who already have a dedicated following. If you come across a particular TikTok star who you think might make a good promotional partner, reach out to them via direct message and see if they would be interested in joining forces.Keep in mind that the most influential figures on social media are usually professionals, so you should be prepared to provide compensation if you want to hitch a ride on their reputation. With the right spokesperson, you could see an explosion in your follower numbers and outside web traffic literally overnight.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":653}

{"conversations":["How to claim tax back?","Typically you pay taxes on your income throughout the year \u2013 but over the course of a year, your life may change drastically. You may lose your job, get a new job that pays less money, get married, have a child, or buy a house. As a result of any of these changes, you may find that you've paid too much in taxes. When you pay too much, you typically are entitled to a refund. In most countries, you must file a return to claim tax back.\n\n## Take deductions and credit\n\n1. Report major life changes. Getting married, having a child, or buying a house are examples of positive life changes that can mean you don't owe as much tax. Negative changes, such as losing your job or getting a divorce, may have the same result. You also may be entitled to a tax refund if your residency status has changed. For example, non-residents may pay a higher tax rate than residents. If you become a permanent resident during the tax year, you may be able to get some of those higher taxes back. The government typically doesn't automatically make these changes for you and reassess your tax liability. Instead, you have to report the change and claim a refund for the amount you overpaid.\n2. Keep records of medical expenses. If you have medical expenses that weren't covered by insurance, you may be able to deduct some or all of those expenses on your taxes. Save your receipts so you have them at year's end. This typically only applies to bills you've actually paid. For example, if you have a $12,000 hospital bill for emergency treatment and you've only paid half of it so far, you could only deduct that half you paid. In the following year, you could potentially deduct the other half.\n3. Claim payment of interest. Certain types of interest, such as interest on a mortgage or on student loans, often can be deducted from your income on your taxes. After you make this deduction, you may be eligible to claim tax back. For example, in the U.S. you can get a credit for at least a portion of the interest you paid on your student loans. When you claim a credit, the government treats it as though you'd actually paid that money on your taxes, which could result in you getting a refund.\n4. Complete the appropriate forms. If you plan to claim any deductions or credits, you typically must file a tax return that allows you to itemize. Even if you typically don't have to file a return each year, you'll need one if you want to claim tax back. For example, taxes in the UK typically are automatically reconciled. If you're employed and earn an hourly wage or a salary, you shouldn't have to file a return. But if you want to claim deductions or credits, you may have to file a return to get that tax back that you overpaid.\n5. Provide proof that you are entitled to the credit or deduction. In many cases, if you're claiming a credit or deduction on your taxes, you must be able to prove that you actually incurred that expense. Even if you aren't required to submit this proof, you should still keep it in your records in case your return is audited. For example, if you or someone in your household is disabled, you may be eligible to take the disability tax credit. However, before you can claim this credit you need a letter from a doctor certifying the disability.\n6. Submit your return by the deadline. Your government may have strict deadlines by which you must file a return if you are requesting a refund. In some countries, the government will pay you interest on the amount of tax you overpaid, provided a deadline is met. While most governments will give you a few years to request a refund of overpaid taxes, the process may be more cumbersome if you wait. File your tax return as soon as possible if you're due a refund, so you can get your money back.\n\n\n## Report business expense\n\n1. Keep records throughout the year. If you're self-employed or own your own business, you can deduct your business expenses from the money you earn throughout the year. Even if you work for a salary or hourly wage, you still may be able to deduct work-related expenses. If you buy anything for work purposes, keep the receipt. You can also use a bookkeeping or personal finance app to help you keep track throughout the year.\n2. Review expenses you can deduct. Your government's tax department should have a list of the types of expenses you can deduct from your income. If you have significant business expenses, you may want to consult a professional tax advisor or accountant. To deduct a business expense, you generally must be able to prove that it was related to your work, and that you paid for it yourself. You can't deduct expenses that your employer reimbursed. If your employer reimbursed you for part of the expense, though, you may be able to deduct the portion that wasn't reimbursed. Talk to a tax advisor about certain expenses, such as travel expenses. These may not be entirely deductible.\n3. Use the appropriate tax return form. If you have expenses related to self-employment, you typically must fill out a separate form for the income you have related to that self-employment. Your business expenses are deductible from that income. For example, suppose you have a day job that pays you an hourly wage, and you also occasionally give people rides through a ride-share app. You would be required to report your income from ride-sharing on your taxes, but you could deduct any related expenses. This could include a portion of your car payment and car insurance.\n4. Submit your tax returns. To deduct business expenses on your taxes, you must submit your yearly tax return. In some cases, you may be required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year if your income from self-employment is over a certain amount set by your government. If you have significant business expenses, it may take you a little longer to complete your return, so don't wait until the last minute.\n5. Keep receipts for expenses you deducted. You typically don't have to provide the receipts or proof of your business expenses to the government when you submit your tax returns. However, if your return is audited, you must be able to produce this documentation. Generally, you want to keep these records for at least 4 or 5 years. Check with your government's tax department to find out how far back returns can be audited, and make sure you're keeping your records for at least that long, just in case.\n\n\n## Adjust your withhold\n\n1. Check the withholding on your paycheck. Especially if you've recently started a new job, you may find that too much money is being withheld from your paycheck for taxes. Check your pay stub or talk to someone in your employer's payroll department to find out how withholding is computed. It's generally a good idea to revisit the amount being withheld from your paycheck for taxes whenever you have a major life change that you would report on your taxes. Major life changes that could potentially affect your tax liability include getting a second job, being unemployed for any period of time, getting married or divorced, or having a child.\n2. Determine your appropriate tax bracket. If your overall household income has changed for any reason, there may be too much tax withheld from your paycheck. Estimate your tax liability for the year and compare it to your government's tax scheme. If you live in the U.S., you can do this fairly easily in most cases by filling out a new W-4. If the result is different from the one you have on file with your employer, your employer should update their records.\n3. Complete new withholding forms. You may be able to submit changes to your withholding online, or you may have to fill out new paper forms with your employer's payroll department. Speak to a manager or someone in human resources and let them know you need to make this change.\n4. Verify the change has been made. Once your withholding has been adjusted, you should notice that less money is being taken out of each paycheck. If the amount being withheld hasn't changed, get back to someone in payroll. Some countries, such as the UK, may issue you a refund directly through your employer if you overpaid on taxes throughout the year.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":785}
{"conversations":["Can you explain why we need a large number of trees in random forest when the number of predictors is large?  How can we determine the optimal number of trees?","Random forest uses bagging (picking a sample of observations rather than all of them) and random subspace method (picking a sample of features rather than all of them, in other words - attribute bagging) to grow a tree. If the number of observations is large, but the number of trees is too small, then some observations will be predicted only once or even not at all. If the number of predictors is large but the number of trees is too small, then some features can (theoretically) be missed in all subspaces used. Both cases results in the decrease of random forest predictive power. But the last is a rather extreme case, since the selection of subspace is performed at each node.\n\nDuring classification the subspace dimensionality is $\\sqrt{p}$ (rather small, $p$ is the total number of predictors) by default, but a tree contains many nodes. During regression the subspace dimensionality is $p\/3$ (large enough) by default, though a tree contains fewer nodes. So the optimal number of trees in a random forest depends on the number of predictors only in extreme cases. \n\nThe official page of the algorithm states that random forest does not overfit, and you can use as much trees as you want. But Mark R. Segal (April 14 2004. \"Machine Learning Benchmarks and Random Forest Regression.\" Center for Bioinformatics & Molecular Biostatistics) has found that it overfits for some noisy datasets. So to obtain optimal number you can try training random forest at a grid of ```ntree``` parameter (simple, but more CPU-consuming) or build one random forest with many trees with ```keep.inbag```, calculate out-of-bag (OOB) error rates for first $n$ trees (where $n$ changes from $1$ to ```ntree```) and plot OOB error rate vs. number of trees (more complex, but less CPU-consuming)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":167}

{"conversations":["In D&D, how many attacks can a fighter with two-weapon fighting make at 5th level?","Answer: 3 attacks on your turn (if you don't use Action Surge). (It could go up to five with Action Surge, though.)\n\nThe Two-Weapon Fighting rule states (PHB, page 195):\n\n>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in the other hand. You don\u2019t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\nThe bonus action used as part of Two-Weapon Fighting is an attack, but it is not the Attack action.\nWhen you are a 5th-level fighter and you take the Attack action, you can make two attacks. You can also use your bonus action to make an additional attack. Notably, you can only take one bonus action per turn, since the rules for bonus actions state:\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou only add your ability modifier to the damage of that bonus-action attack if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style (PHB, page 72):\n\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability\nmodifier to the damage of the second attack.\n\nTherefore, you are taking the Attack action (2 attacks) and then making an additional attack with your bonus action (1 attack), for a total of 3 attacks if you're using your action plus your bonus action. There's a clear difference between them.\nAction Surge lets a 5th-level fighter attack up to 5 times in one turn, once per short rest.\n\nThe description of the Action Surge feature says (PHB, page 72):\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.\n\nWhich means that if you use Action Surge, you would have 2 actions and 1 bonus action on your turn.\nSo with this, you can take your Attack action (2 attacks), then use Action Surge and take another Attack action (2 more attacks), and finally your Two-Weapon Fighting bonus action (one more attack), for a total of 5 attacks during your turn."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":302}

Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do.

{"conversations":["I'm no expert in darkroom photography, but it seems a little odd that there is a type of light that doesn't affect film or developing paper etc. So why is a dark-room safelight safe?","Photo films and papers are made from salts of silver that naturally only darken when exposed to violet or blue light. In the early days of photography, this was all that was available. Therefore these films and papers are able to be handled under any light source that does not radiate blue light. By the way, the violet and blue frequencies of light are the shortest, and are the most energetic when it comes to inducing a chemical change. These early films and papers could all be be handled safely under red light as well as yellow light. These lamps do not emit violet or blue. \n\nThese blue-sensitive-only films did an OK job, with some exceptions. Women\u2019s faces with cosmetics, like lipstick and rouge on the cheeks, came out weird. Warm tones reproduced super dark, and most times lips and cheeks turned black, void of detail on the finished picture. The bottom line is, many colors in nature reproduced incorrectly with this early blue-sensitive-only film. \n\nThe cure was accidental. Professor Hermann Vogel at Berlin Technical was trying to solve the problem of halation. This results when taking a picture of bright objects, like light sources or gemstones and the like. These objects play on the film with lots of light energy. This energy often goes completely through the film and hits something behind the film. The light is then reflected back into the film. The result is a halo around bright objects. The professor had one of his students dye the silver salts yellow, thinking the yellow dye would filter out the annoying reflected blue from the rear. He tried this dyed film and it did the trick, plus the film gained sensitivity to green light. He named this blue\/green sensitive film orthochromatic (Latin for correct color). The year was 1857, and the quality of film reproducing the colors of nature moved forward by a big leap. \n\nA few years later, one of his graduate students, experimenting with different dyes, discovered how to make films sensitive to blue, green and red light. This film was called panchromatic (the pan prefix in Greek means \"all\"). Thus panchromatic film reproduces all colors found in nature with high accuracy. The bad news was, the darkroom folks were forced to give up the red and yellow safelight. A super dim green safelight could be used for a short period of time during developing. \n\nPhoto papers remained insensitive to red for the most part - no need, as they work OK with just blue and green sensitivity. Modern variable contrast photo papers have two sensitive coats, one for blue light and one for green light. We can use a safelight on these papers; it is amber with reduced brilliance. \n\nFilms and papers that make color pictures are panchromatic, and most safelights are not safe. We can use infrared lamps with a specialized night vision infrared scope to view and handle most panchromatic films and papers, because these materials have low sensitivity to infrared."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":115}

{"conversations":["What is the 3-day itinerary for experiencing the highlights of New York?","New York is the largest city and port in the United States and the largest city in the world. Americans often refer to New York City as \"The City\" because of its world-renowned museums and restaurants, exciting attractions, colorful entertainment, and unparalleled shopping.\n\nDay 1: \n\n*  Sightseeing guideline: Metropolitan Museum of Art (3 hours) \u2192 Central Park (3 hours) \u2192 Times Square (2 hours)\nThe first day's itinerary revolves around exploring the western part of Midtown Manhattan. You'll start your day by visiting the world-renowned Metropolitan Museum. Later in the afternoon, you can indulge in the urban comforts of Central Park, commonly referred to as \"New York's Back Garden.\" And finally, in the evening, immerse yourself in the vibrant city life of Times Square.\n*  Traffic guideline: If you're traveling in New York City, it's recommended that you use the subway or bus system for transportation, as it's convenient and relatively inexpensive (a one-way subway ticket costs $2.75). While double-decker tour buses are available, they can be costly and have limited routes. Some may even have Chinese guides, but they're not recommended. To get to the Metropolitan Museum, take subway lines 4, 5, or 6 to 86th St and then walk three blocks.\n*  Catering Guideline: The metropolitan nature of New York City has resulted in an incredibly diverse food culture. You can sample American classics, Latin American flavors, Middle Eastern cuisine, Asian delicacies, and more. Whether you're looking for cheap street food or Michelin-starred restaurants, there's something to suit every budget and taste preference. However, it's worth noting that there aren't many food options near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nDay 2: \n\n*  Sightseeing guideline: Statue of Liberty (4 hours) \u2192 Wall Street (4 hours) \u2192 Trinity Church (1 hour) \u2192 Ground Zero (9\/11 World Trade Center)(1 hour) \u2192 Brooklyn Bridge (1 hour)\nToday's itinerary centers around the lower Manhattan area. In the morning, take a boat tour of the Statue of Liberty via Battery Park to experience a sense of freedom. Then, in the afternoon, visit Ground Zero to pay tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack. Afterward, explore Wall Street, the world's financial hub. Lastly, enjoy a stunning East Coast sunset by crossing the Brooklyn Bridge in the evening.\n*  Traffic guideline: To reach Wall Street, take Subway Line 4 and get off at Wall St Station. For the 49th St Station, take Subway Lines N, Q, or R. To access the Times Square accommodation area, take Subway Line 1 to the 50th St Station or Subway Lines B, D, F, or M to the 47-50 Sts-Rockefeller Ctr station.\n*  Catering Guideline: There are numerous dining options available around Battery Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, including bagel breakfasts, American snacks, Italian cuisine, and bacon sandwiches. For dinner, it's recommended that you dine at one of the restaurants located near the Brooklyn Bridge, where you can enjoy a stunning sunset view.\n\nDay 3: \n\n*  Sightseeing guideline: United Nations Headquarters (2 hours) \u2192 Grand Central Terminal (1 hour) \u2192 Rockefeller Center (1 hour) \u2192 Empire State Building (2 hours)\nToday's itinerary focuses on the east Midtown Manhattan area. Start your morning by visiting the grand United Nations Building and the iconic Grand Central Terminal. Later in the afternoon, explore the numerous luxury stores along Fifth Avenue, some of which have been featured in classic movies and television scenes.\n*  Traffic guideline: In New York City, subway bus travel is recommended, which is convenient and relatively cheap ($2.75 one-way subway ticket). Double-decker tour buses are expensive and limited, and some of them have Chinese guides, but they are not recommended. Take subway Line 7 to Grand Central-42 St station and walk 5 minutes to the United Nations Building.\n*  Catering Guideline: Today's itinerary focuses on attractions near Koreatown and Times Square. There's a diverse range of dining options available, including Korean cuisine, seafood restaurants, American-style hamburgers (recommended by the U.S. Tourism Board), classic hotdogs, and beloved New York coffee shops.\n\nThere are numerous other attractions worth visiting in New York City. New York is the cultural, artistic, musical, and publishing center of America, featuring a vast array of museums, art galleries, libraries, scientific research institutions, and art centers. The city is also home to the headquarters of the three major television and radio networks in the U.S. and several influential newspapers and news agencies. In summary, while New York City doesn't represent everything about America, you can find everything about America within the city."],"source":"authors","idx":512}

Is there any physical method for that gas or liquid to pass through that thick heavy metal block (not by drilling etc.)?","Yes, some gases can diffuse into and through metal. It is the bane of the high-vacuum engineer's life. Hydrogen is the worst because it tends to dissociate into atoms at the surface and the nucleus, a single proton, can then leave its electron behind and wander through the metal lattice until it picks up another electron when it leaves.\n\nFor example Mu-metal, favoured for some applications, typically has to be annealed in hydrogen at high temperature. Once that is over, it can take weeks or months for the residual hydrogen to diffuse out of the metal before a high enough vacuum can be achieved and the work proceed.\n\nA &quot;virtual leak&quot; occurs where a small bubble of gas is embedded in the material inside a vacuum chamber. The leak usually happens because a tiny hole exists for the gas to diffuse out through, but sometimes the &quot;hole&quot; is no more than an ultra-thin skin of metal (invisible to the frustrated technician) and the gas diffuses through it. These little horrors can keep going for months or even years and generally mean replacing suspected parts and pumping down over and over again until the dodgy one is finally stumbled on.\n\nHelium is both monatomic and the physically smallest atom. It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":171}

Moreover, C\u266f is one semitone above C and D\u266d is one semitone below D. Therefore, C\u266f and D\u266d should be equivalent. If so, how can C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ by 41 cents from each other?","When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C\u266f to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F\u266f minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C\u266f is not the same as D\u266d, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C\u266f might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D\u266d might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":389}

Why don't they have more kids and build bigger societies?","Tolkien himself addresses this in an essay called &quot;Laws and Customs Among the Eldar&quot;. There are essentially two problems:\n\n* Elvish libido diminishes over time. Contrary to popular belief (and outward appearance, from a human perspective), Elves do age; and as they get older, they get less interested in procreation.\n* Having children is exhausting. The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting.

Then, our frequency bin resolution is:\n$$\\frac{5\\ \\text{kHz}}{4096\\ \\,\\text{FFT bins}} \\simeq \\frac{1.22\\ \\text{Hz}}{\\text{bin}}$$\n\nThis is may be the easier way to explain it conceptually but simplified: &nbsp;your bin resolution is just \\$\\frac{f_{samp}}{N}\\$, where \\$f_{samp}\\$ is the input signal's sampling rate and N is the number of FFT points used (sample length).\n\nWe can see from the above that to get smaller FFT bins we can either run a longer FFT (that is, take more samples at the same rate before running the FFT) or decrease our sampling rate.\n\n## The Catch:\nThere is always a trade-off between temporal resolution and frequency resolution.\n\nIn the example above, we need to collect 8192 samples before we can run the FFT, which when sampling at 10 kHz takes 0.82 seconds. \n\nIf we tried to get smaller FFT bins by running a longer FFT it would take even longer to collect the needed samples.\nThat may be OK, it may not be.  The important point is that at a fixed sampling rate, increasing frequency resolution decreases temporal resolution. That is the more accurate your measurement in the frequency domain, the less accurate you can be in the time domain. You effectively lose all time information inside the FFT length.\n\nIn this example, if a 1999 Hz tone starts and stops in the first half of the 8192 sample FFT and a 2002 Hz tone plays in the second half of the window, we would see both, but they would appear to have occurred at the same time.\n\nYou also have to consider processing time.  A 8192 point FFT takes some decent processing power.  A way to reduce this need is to reduce the sampling rate, which is the second way to increase frequency resolution.\n\nIn your example, if you drop your sampling rate to something like 4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1 Hz bins *4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1hz bins and can still resolve a 2khz signal.  This reduces the FFT bin size, but also reduces the bandwidth of the signal.\n\nUltimately with an FFT there will always be a trade off between frequency resolution and time resolution.  You have to perform a bit of a balancing act to reach all goals."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":313}
{"conversations":["What would have happened if Ming dynasty China crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th Century? Discuss the exact details of how something like this could happen and how it would effect history up to the present day.","If Ming dynasty China had crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th century, history as we know it would have been dramatically altered. Here is one speculation of how such a scenario might have unfolded and its potential repercussions up to the present day.\n\nReal History: In the early 1400s, the Ming dynasty, under Emperor Yongle, carried out ambitious naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He, who explored and established trade relations across the Indian Ocean and as far west as Africa.\n\nHypothetical Scenario: In this alternate history, Zheng He's fleet ventures further eastward, crossing the Pacific Ocean and reaching present-day California.\n\nHow does this scenario play out?\n\n* Upon discovering the Americas, the Chinese encounter indigenous civilizations and establish trading relations with them. This leads to the establishment of Chinese settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Chinese settlers import advanced technologies, including gunpowder, paper, printing, and agricultural practices, transforming the lives of indigenous peoples. At the same time, the introduction of Old World diseases decimates indigenous populations, akin to the Columbian exchange in our timeline.\n\n* Over the 1500s and 1600s, hybrid Chinese-indigenous societies form throughout the Americas, forming unique cultures, languages, and religions. The trans-Pacific trade between China and its colonies sparks an economic golden age in China, making it the richest empire on Earth. By reinvesting its newfound wealth in its military, the Ming dynasty does not collapse as in our timeline, instead becoming the number one naval power in the world.\n\n* In parallel, Europeans do eventually arrive in the Americas and settle parts of the Atlantic coast. Contact between Chinese and European colonies, particularly in Central America, ignites a series of local conflicts, culminating in an acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty over modern-day Mexico in exchange for civil and cultural rights for indigenous peoples and European settlers, enforced through a non-interventionist policy of the Chinese colonial government. By creating the world\u2019s first de facto multicultural territory, this agreement facilitates a steady flow of goods, technologies, and ideas between Chinese, European, and indigenous cultures, influencing humanistic ideologies that spread throughout the New World.\n\n* Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, a unique American identity emerges from the multicultural melting pot, based on universal humanist values. This new generation of Americans finds itself at odds with Old World notions of national identity and monarchy, and eventually rebel against Chinese, European, and other external influences.

{"conversations":["Instead of a modern adaptation of a myth, write a mythic adaptation of a modern story.","As a young man in Delphi, Gouli\u00e9lmos generally rushed through lessons with his tutors in order to run outside and wrestle and throw javelins and race chariots.  As a result, his standing in the academy was low, but at sport he had few equals, and this gave him great confidence and arrogance.\nOne day, Dionysus and Hermes, bored, descended Mount Olympus disguised as mortals and found Gouli\u00e9lmos wrestling with his friends.  As they arrived, Gouli\u00e9lmos had just defeated one of them, and declared boastfully, \"I am the greatest wrestler in western Delphi!  No two of you at once could defeat me.\"  Dionysus and Hermes stepped forward and engaged Gouli\u00e9lmos, defeating him handily, and while Hermes sought only to win, Dionysus tore into his flesh.\nWhen Gouli\u00e9lmos returned home that night, his mother nearly fainted at his wounds.  \"You've been wrestling outside the academy again!\" she cried.  \"And now you stagger in here half-dead, covered in blood!  Delphi is no place for you.  I am sending you to Byblos, where you will live with my sister Maria and her husband Philippos.  There is no wrestling in Byblos.\"\nDespondent, Gouli\u00e9lmos booked passage on a carriage.  When it arrived, his mood was briefly lifted by its unusual decorations, with dangling baubles and fresh paint.  Though he did not know it, Hermes, who was feeling guilty for Gouli\u00e9lmos' injuries, was driving the carriage.  Gouli\u00e9lmos, unaware of this and remembering his exile from Dephi, forgot his relief and told Hermes, \"To Byblos.\"\nArriving in Byblos, Gouli\u00e9lmos felt his spirits lift once more.  Delphi was and always would be his home, but Byblos was beautiful, clean, and wealthy beyond anything he knew existed.  Around 7 or 8 in the evening, his carriage pulled up in front of a grand palace of white marble.  \"If I must live here in exile from Delphi,\" thought Gouli\u00e9lmos, \"I shall make the most of it.

{"conversations":["What's the best way to iterate over the items in a ```HashMap```?","Extracted from the reference How to Iterate Over a Map in Java:\nThere are several ways of iterating over a ```Map``` in Java. Let's go over the most common methods and review their advantages and disadvantages. Since all maps in Java implement the Map interface, the following techniques will work for any map implementation (```HashMap```, ```TreeMap```, ```LinkedHashMap```, ```Hashtable```, etc.)\n\nMethod #1: Iterating over entries using a For-Each loop.\nThis is the most common method and is preferable in most cases. It should be used if you need both map keys and values in the loop.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nNote that the For-Each loop was introduced in Java 5, so this method is working only in newer versions of the language. Also a For-Each loop will throw ```NullPointerException``` if you try to iterate over a map that is null, so before iterating you should always check for null references.\n\nMethod #2: Iterating over keys or values using a For-Each loop.\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, you can iterate over keySet or values instead of entrySet.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\n\/\/ Iterating over keys only\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key);\n}\n\/\/ Iterating over values only\nfor (Integer value : map.values()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis method gives a slight performance advantage over ```entrySet``` iteration (about 10% faster) and is more clean.\n\nMethod #3: Iterating using Iterator.\nUsing Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator> entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = entries.next();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nWithout Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) entries.next();\n    Integer key = (Integer)entry.getKey();\n    Integer value = (Integer)entry.getValue();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nYou can also use same technique to iterate over ```keySet``` or values.\nThis method might look redundant, but it has its own advantages. First of all, it is the only way to iterate over a map in older versions of Java. The other important feature is that it is the only method that allows you to remove entries from the map during iteration by calling ```iterator.remove()```. If you try to do this during For-Each iteration you will get \"unpredictable results\" according to Javadoc.\nFrom a performance point of view this method is equal to a For-Each iteration.\n\nMethod #4: Iterating over keys and searching for values (inefficient).\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    Integer value = map.get(key);\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis might look like a cleaner alternative for method #1, but in practice it is pretty slow and inefficient as getting values by a key might be time-consuming (this method in different Map implementations is 20%-200% slower than method #1). If you have FindBugs installed, it will detect this and warn you about inefficient iteration. This method should be avoided.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, use method #2. If you are stuck with older version of Java (less than 5) or planning to remove entries during iteration, you have to use method #3. Otherwise use method #1."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":279}
{"conversations":["How to lessen the pressure of life?","## Reduce the pressure of life\n\n1. Start a stress journal to identify and reflect on the sources of pressure in your life. Are you experiencing financial pressure? Are you experiencing stresses at a new job or as a result of a job loss? A stress journal can help you identify the most significant sources of stress in your life and how you cope with them. This self knowledge will help you tackle the biggest stressors in your life. You can also reflect on the specific situations within which you experience higher stress levels. Do you experience more stress at particular times of the week or in particular spaces (e.g., a conference room) at work? Are there ways of avoiding such situations entirely, or responding more effectively to them? Reflect on these kinds of questions and work towards insights on how to manage stress through journaling. Create a list of everything you are grateful for in your life. Recognizing the good things in your life can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n2. Take a stress assessment test. There may be stressors that are so normal in your life that you don't even realize they're stressing you out. A stress assessment test can help you identify these hidden stressors. There are many online tests that you can do. You can take a free stress assessment test online at https:\/\/www.stress.org\/self-assessment\/.\n3. Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":689}

I am then given another ciphertext that I should decrypt.\nI know that XOR-ing two ciphers gives me the XOR of their original messages.\nMy question is what is the correct thing to do after that?\nI tried to take 3 ciphertexts $C_1, C_2$ and $C_3$.\nThen get $S_1 = C_1 \\oplus C_2  \\oplus $```' '```, also get $S_2 = C_1 \\oplus C_3 \\oplus$ ```' '```.\nAfter that I compared all corresponding characters in $S_1$ and $S_2$,\nand if $S_1[i] = S_2[i]$ then I calculate $S_1[i] \\oplus C_2[i]$ to get $K[i]$.\nI tried this on paper before coding and it worked, but I might be missing something.\nIs this the right approach? Why does it work?","The classical answer to \"what is the correct thing to do after you have the XOR of the two original messages\" is crib-dragging.\n\nThat is, you take a guess of a common phrase that may appear in one of the plaintexts (the classical example against ASCII english is the 5 letter \" the \"), and exclusive-or that against the XOR of the two original messages in various locations.  If one of the plaintexts had the text of the crib (\" the \" in our example), then the result of the exclusive-or is what the other plaintext had in that position; if neither plaintext had that, it's likely that the result of the exclusive-or is just gibberish.  And, once you have a plausible short section, you can extend it (for example, if you know that one of the plaintexts is \" na**\", you can go through the dictionary of all words that start with \"na\", use those as cribs, and see which makes the other plaintext make sense).\n\nIn addition, you can often deduce things directly from the bit pattern.  For example, if the messages are in ASCII, then one thing to note that bit 6 of letters is set, but bit 6 of spaces, numbers and (most) punctuation is clear; because spaces are far more common than numbers and punctuation, then that will give you a good guess of where spaces occur in the texts (albeit without telling you which message a specific space appears in).\n\nNow, if you have 11 messages all encrypted with the same pad (an \"11-time pad\"), things get even easier.  Obviously, you can grab a crib across one message, and check it against the other 10; if it makes all 10 make sense, then it is almost certainly accurate.  Even better, by using the observation that you can distinguish spaces from letters (again, by comparing bit 6), you can find where all the spaces appear in the messages; these all act like 1 character cribs, probably revealing virtually all the text of all the messages."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":381}

{"conversations":["Apparently, the air inside a soap bubble is under higher pressure than the surrounding air. This is for instance apparent in the sound bubbles make when they burst. Why is the pressure inside the bubble higher in the first place?","The increased pressure is caused by the surface tension between the soap and the surrounding air. This can be seen by a simple equilibrium energy argument. The total energy of the system reads\n$$\n  E = E_i + E_o + E_s \\;,\n$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the energy associated with the air inside the bubble, $E_s$ is the interfacial energy, and $E_o$ denotes the energy associated with the air outside of the bubble. Importantly, the contribution of the surface energy is given by $E_s = 2 \\gamma A$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $A$ is the surface area of the bubble. The factor of 2 emerges, since there are actually two interfaces (one facing the inside of the soap bubble and one facing the outside).\n\nIn equilibrium, the total energy will be minimal. We thus analyze the total differential of the energy. Here, the differentials of the partial energies of the air can be approximated by the ideal gas law, which yields $dE_i = -p_i dV_i$ and $dE_o = -p_o dV_o$.\n\nNext, we have to discuss the degrees of freedom of the system. Generally, the soap bubble wants to keep its spherical shape to minimize the surface area (and thus the surface energy $E_s$) at a given volume. This leaves us with a single parameter, the radius $R$ of the bubble, which can be varied in any process. The volume differentials then become $dV_1 = 4\\pi R^2 dR$ and $dV_2 = -4\\pi R^2 dR$. Additionally, the surface area changes by $dA = 8\\pi R dR$. The differential of the surface energy thus reads $dE_s = 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR$, provided that the surface tension stays constant.\n\nNow we got everything and can express the differential of the total energy as\n$$\n  dE = -p_i 4 \\pi R^2 dR + p_o 4\\pi R^2 dR + 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR \\;.\n$$\nDividing by $4\\pi R^2$ and noting that $dE\/dR$ vanishes in equilibrium, we thus arrive at\n$$\n  p_i - p_o = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R} \\;.\n$$\nThis expression shows that the pressure inside the bubble is large than outside. The pressure difference is two times the Laplace pressure $2\\gamma\/R$.","Can this be viewed intuitively from the perpective of the fact that in order for a bubble to form a higher-pressure must be applied to the air in front of the bubble; i.e. it must be blown into? Since this high-pressure air is the air that goes into the bubble, shouldn't this air be of this higher pressure for all time, rather like a balloon?","It is true, that the ideas employed here are the same that would explain why the pressure inside a balloon is higher than outside. In order to inflate a balloon you want to blow extra air inside it. This is only possible when the pressure you create in your mouth is larger than the pressure in the interior of the balloon, since the air always flows from regions of large to small pressure in this example. Consequently, the fact that your have to blow quite a bit means that there is quite some pressure inside the balloon."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1026}

If you want a meatless version \u2013 which doesn\u2019t require pre-cooking the quinoa or vegetables \u2013 opt for the vegetable lasagna, with mouth-watering mushrooms, spinach and onion in a red sauce. The spinach and chicken version has similar ingredients, but is prepared differently. The quinoa is rinsed, drained and boiled first, and the veggies are sauteed on the stovetop before baking the lasagna. Pair either lasagna with a complimentary beverage, and serve vegetables and dipping bread on the side.\n\n## Bake vegetable lasagna\n\n1. Chop vegetables while the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Use a large chopping knife to dice the mushrooms. Dice the onions more finely than the mushrooms.\n2. Line a greased casserole dish with veggies and quinoa. Spray the dish generously with coconut oil cooking spray. Place the spinach, mushrooms and onions into the dish. Sprinkle the uncooked quinoa on top.\n3. Mix up the marinara in a medium bowl. Combine the marinara sauce with the vegetable broth, cottage and ricotta cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, sea salt and ground pepper. You can use 1% cottage cheese and full-fat ricotta cheese, or opt for whatever type you like of each.\n4. Combine the marinara with the contents of the casserole dish. Pour the marinara mixture over the veggies and quinoa. Mix all of the ingredients together with a large spoon. Ensure that the sauce mixture mostly covers the other ingredients.\n5. Bake the covered casserole for one hour. Cover the dish with tin foil. After 30 minutes, remove the lasagna and stir it. Replace the foil cover and put the dish back in the oven for another 30 minutes. At the halfway mark, it\u2019s normal for the dish to appear a bit watery.\n6. Add the toppings and cook for two minutes. Arrange sliced tomatoes and shredded mozzarella to the top of the lasagna. Replace the tin foil. After cooking, let the dish cool for about ten minutes before serving it.\n7. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store the lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate for up to five days. If freezing, allow the lasagna to cool completely first. Let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. Try a glass pyrex dish for refrigeration. Try a disposable aluminum casserole dish for freezing. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the lasagna and push all of the air out before wrapping the whole dish in tin foil.\n\n\n## Make spinach and chicken lasagna\n\n1.

Continue cooking for about fourteen minutes. Remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for five minutes. Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork. The quinoa is finished cooking when the liquid has all been absorbed.\n2. Sautee onion, garlic and mushrooms. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Pour in the vegetables. Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onions are translucent.\n3. Cook ground chicken with the veggies. Over low to medium heat, cook the chicken for six to seven minutes in with the onion, garlic and mushroom you just sauteed. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to break up the meat as it cooks, until it is no longer pink.\n4. Add spinach, tomatoes and seasonings. Add spinach to the saucepan and cook it for two minutes, stirring continually, until the spinach leaves wilt. Mix in tomatoes, basil, salt, red pepper, oregano and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about ten minutes, until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat. The mixture must be thick, not runny, for the lasagna to set properly.\n5. Combine quinoa, cheese and sauce as the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Add the quinoa, ricotta and 1\/2 cup (95 g) of grated mozzarella into the sauce mixture and fold it in, then mix well. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. You can use a 9\u201d (23 cm) x 13\u201d (33 cm) oven-safe casserole dish.\n6. Add the topping to the lasagna. Smooth the top of the lasagna with a spatula. Sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella on top in a single layer. Pour the Parmesan and breadcrumbs on top.\n7. Bake the lasagna for 30-35 minutes. Allow it to cool for at least five minutes before you serve it. The lasagna is done when the top is bubbling and lightly browned. If you want it browner, you can put it under the boiler for about a minute at the end.\n8. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store your lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate the lasagna for up to five days. If you want to freeze it, allow the lasagna to cool entirely first. Allow it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. For example, you can refrigerate the lasagna in a glass pyrex dish with a lid. For instance, place the lasagna in a disposable casserole dish. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top, then push all of the air out. Wrap the entire dish in foil, and freeze.\n\n\n## Compliment quinoa lasagna\n\n1. Serve the lasagna with vegetables. Add chopped fresh basil to the top of the lasagna, or fresh basil leaves on the side of the plate. Serve a tossed salad, steamed vegetables, or roasted vegetables alongside the lasagna. For example, thickly-sliced, cooked zucchini goes well with quinoa lasagna. Serve cooked spinach, or fresh spinach as a side salad. Make sweet potatoes, which go well with quinoa lasagna.\n2. Serve complimentary beverages. Red sauce goes well with a glass of red wine. If you prefer white, opt for something crisp and dry. Other options are non-alcoholic beer, or sparkling water with muddled herbs. Try a red wine from southern Italy, such as from Tuscany. Another option is a light Sicilian red wine. Try a white wine like Pinot Grigio or Verdicchio.\n3. Serve thick, crusty bread with dipping oil on the side. Combine olive oil with lemon juice, grated Parmesan cheese, and dried herbs\/seasonings, to taste. For example, try 1\/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil, a squirt of lemon juice, and a teaspoon (4 g) of Parmesan. Tap out a small sprinkle \u2013 1\/2 teaspoon (2 g) or less \u2013 each of dried basil, parsley, thyme, oregano, black pepper, rosemary, salt, and red pepper. Mix in 1\/2 teaspoon (2 g) of minced garlic, if desired.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":615}

{"conversations":["I recently had someone claim (on an unrelated SE site I won't link to) that it is the responsibility of a player to correctly identify their hand, that what you &quot;call&quot; your hand determines the winner:\n\nFor example, you have an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. You call your hand and say, &quot;I have a Straight!&quot;\nBut that was a bad move on your part because you are a novice player and you did not notice that all of your cards are Spades. You actually had a Straight Flush, but now you have lost because one of the remaining players had a Full House.\nYour hand has not been determined until you call your hand.\n\nIs this true? Clearly you might play your hand differently if you misunderstand what you have, but I always thought that the cards speak for themselves once they are revealed.\nOr would it depend on the specific poker variation\/house rules?","Casinos in the US generally have the \"cards speak\" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":127}

{"conversations":["How to stretch your quads (quadriceps)?","The quadriceps are a group of four muscles that run down your thighs. Virtually every athletic activity or exercise engages your quads, so it's important for them to be flexible and strong. To maintain healthy quads, stretch them before and after exercise. You can also use yoga to increase the flexibility in your quads, which can make them less prone to injury.\n\n## Warm up your quads\n\n1. Walk or bike for 10 to 15 minutes. A gentle cardio exercise such as walking or biking will get the blood flowing to your quads and make stretching more comfortable. Stretching cold muscles could result in injury. If you're planning on exercising outside in cooler weather, add 5 to 10 minutes to your warm-up time before you start stretching.\n2. Do standing quad stretches before a long run. From a standing position with your knees together, lift one foot and grasp it with your hand. Gently press your foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other foot. This stretch can be done both before and after a long run or other physical activity, as part of your warm-up or cool-down. You can also do this stretch while lying on one side. Brace your core to keep your spine in alignment and help stabilize your pelvis.\n3. Add kneeling stretches to target quads and hip flexors. Kneel on the floor on one knee. You may want to rest your knee on a folded towel or mat. Lean forward slightly, with your other foot flat on the floor and your knees at right angles. Lean forward, contracting your core and the glute of the kneeling leg. As you exhale, shift your body forward to stretch your quad and other hip flexor muscles. You can rest your hands on your front thigh for balance and stability. Hold the stretch for a 15-40 seconds, then switch and repeat the stretch with the other leg. Keep your spine neutral and your upper body posture straight. You also want to avoid arching, rounding, or flattening your lower back or pulling back against the lean.\n4. Use lunges for dynamic stretching. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart and step one foot forward. Lower your body by bending at the knees until the back knee is nearly at the floor. Your front knee should be in line with your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise up and repeat with the other side. You can do a series of lunges where you gradually move forward, or you can stay in the same place. Start with 2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg. If you have trouble balancing and feel wobbly, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to form a T-shape.\n\n\n## Stretch tight or injure quads\n\n1. Use active range of motion exercises to maintain knee mobility. To complete this stretch, bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion, or as far as you can go without discomfort. You can do this stretch while standing, sitting, or lying down. Choose the position that provides you the most stability and allows you to move your knee the most. This stretch is best soon after an injury, when your movement may be at its most limited. Try to complete 10 repetitions with each leg, but don't overdo it. Stop if you feel pain.\n2. Find a partner for passive quad stretches. Either standing, sitting, or reclining, have your partner grasp your ankle or foot. Your partner will slowly bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion. When your knee is fully bent, have them hold the stretch for a few seconds before slowly moving your foot back down. Passive quad stretches are a good way to stretch your quads if you don't have the control needed to do standing quad stretches on your own. If you're able to move on your own, passive quad stretches may be of little benefit to you. Communication is key with passive stretching. Don't let your partner push your leg to the point that you feel pain in the muscle. This could lead to additional tearing or re-injury.\n3. Relieve tightness with the couch stretch. Kneel with one knee on the ground in front of a couch. Brace the foot of your kneeling leg on the side of the couch. Your other leg should be straight out in front of you with your knee at a right angle and your shin perpendicular to the ground. Push your hips backward as you press your raised heel towards your glute. You can place your hands on your front knee for balance. Hold the stretch for a few seconds or breath cycles, then release and repeat the stretch with the other leg. In addition to a couch, you can also use a wall or low bench to lean your foot against.\n4. Increase stability and control with supine squats. You will need a stability ball for this exercise. Sit on the ball, then walk your feet forward as you gradually lean back at the same time. When you are lying face up, roll forward and allow your knees to move over your toes until your knees are fully flexed. Then contract your quads and roll back until your knees are at 90-degree angles. Try to do 10 repetitions of this exercise. Only go as far as you can without pain or discomfort.\n\n\n## Improve quad flexibility\n\n1. Lengthen your quads with the crescent lunge. From a standing position, step one foot forward and fold over so that your hands are on either side of your foot. Your front knee should be at a right angle with your shin perpendicular to the floor. Raise up on an inhale, sweeping your arms out to the side and overhead. Lower your hips and press downward into the lunge, stretching and lengthening your quads. Breathe deeply and hold the lunge for 30 seconds to a minute. To get out of the pose, lower your hands over your front leg and then walk or jump your front leg back to meet the other leg. You can raise your hips into downward facing dog if you like, then walk or jump the other leg to the front and repeat the lunge on the other side.\n2. Lower into hero pose. Kneel on the floor, touching your inner knees together. Your feet should be slightly wider than your hips with the tops of your feet on the floor. Exhale and lower your hips onto the floor between your feet until your buttocks are resting comfortably on the floor. Lean forward slightly as you lower, wedging your thumbs into the backs of your knees. Breathe deeply, feeling the stretch in your quads, for 30 seconds to a minute. Open your shoulders and drop your shoulder blades down alongside your spine. If you can't sit comfortably on the floor in this position, place a block to sit on, or roll up a blanket or towel.\n3. Stretch your thighs and core with bow pose. Lie face-down on your mat with your arms by your sides, palms up. On an exhale, bend your knees and raise your feet towards your buttocks. Reach back and grab either your ankles or the tops of your feet and pull them forward. As you inhale, lift your feet towards the ceiling as you raise your thighs off the floor. Breathing can be difficult in this position, but gaze forward and focus on breathing as deeply as you can. Hold the pose for 20 to 30 seconds, then slowly release to lay back down. You can use a folded blanket to pad your ribs and hips to make the pose more comfortable.\n4. Open your hip flexors with pigeon pose. Start on all fours with your knees below your hips and wrists below your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward to the back of your right wrist as you pull your foot around to the left side. The side of your right shin should be lying on the mat perpendicular to your torso. Then slide your left leg back until it is flat on the floor. Exhale and raise up so you are in a sitting position with your right leg crossed in front of you and your left leg extending backwards. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then return to all fours and repeat with your left leg in front and your right leg extended behind you. There are many variations to this pose. For example, try folding over your front leg and resting your chest and forehead on the mat for a more intense hip opener. For a really deep quad stretch, raise your back foot towards your buttocks. Grab your back foot or ankle with your hand and press it towards your buttocks to further deepen the stretch.\n5. Bend into camel pose. Kneel with your legs about hip-width apart. Inhale and draw your elbows towards each other behind your body, allowing your sternum to lift and your rib cage to expand. Press your hands into your heels, maintaining the lifting in your sternum and keeping your shoulders back. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Avoid tightening your glutes. Camel pose helps lengthen and improve flexibility in your hip flexors and upper quads. If it is too much of a challenge for you to reach your heels, you might place a block between your feet or lean back over an exercise ball.\n6. Extend your backbend with little thunderbolt pose. Once you're comfortable in camel pose, take it a step further by lowering your head until the crown of your head rests between your feet. Reach your arms forward to grasp your lower thighs. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To come out of the pose, engage the core and slowly roll yourself back up to a kneeling position. Keep your glutes soft to avoid excess pressure on your lower back. This pose opens up your hips and quads. The practice of lifting up with your chest as you lower your torso backwards is an intense workout for your thighs.\n7. Rest in child's pose. Still in a kneeling position, spread your knees slightly and bring your big toes together. On an exhale, fold over your thighs, extending your arms out overhead and resting your forehead on the floor. Breathe deeply in this position for as long as you want. In addition to being a relaxing way to end your practice, child's pose also works as a good counter-pose after backbends.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":617}

{"conversations":["Can a woman give birth to twins with different fathers?","Yes, this is possible through something called heteropaternal superfecundation (see below for further explanation).\nOf all twin births, 30% are identical and 70% are non-identical (fraternal) twins.\n\nIdentical twins result when a zygote (one egg, or ovum, fertilized by one sperm) splits at an early stage to become twins. Because the genetic material is essentially the same, they resemble each other closely.\n\nTypically during ovulation only one ovum is released to be fertilized by one sperm. However, sometimes a woman's ovaries release two ova. Each must be fertilized by a separate sperm cell. If she has intercourse with two different men, the two ova can be fertilized by sperm from different sexual partners. The term for this event is heteropaternal superfecundation (HS): twins who have the same mother, but two different fathers.\n\nThis has been proven in paternity suits (in which there will be a bias selecting for possible infidelity) involving fraternal twins, where genetic testing must be done on each child. The frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation in this group was found (in one study) to be 2.4%. As the study's authors state, \"Inferences about the frequency of HS in other populations should be drawn with caution.\""],"source":"stackexchange","idx":304}
{"conversations":["How to handle a dramatic sister in law?","## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care\/electricity\/shampoo\/dog grooming\/car maintenance\/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother\/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother\/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness\/privacy\/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and\/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":718}

What is a good indicator of when the tire as a whole needs to be replaced?","The tread on a road bike's tires is really quite unimportant and purely cosmetic. Road bike tires have tread patterns because they sell better, not because they perform better.\nHere's some questions to ask to decide about replacing a tire:\n\n* Can you see any of the fabric?\n* Are you getting flats more easily than you used to?\n* Is any part of the tire bulging out or lumpy?\n* Are there visible holes\/gashes in the tire?\n* Does the wear indicator indicate you should replace?  (Some tires have dimples or grooves that are there to indicate when the tire should be replaced.  Some have an alternate color of rubber underneath, and when that shows through the tire should be replaced)\n\nSmooth tread is actually ideal for road conditions, but not commonly found on tires.  If you're on hard surfaces such as pavement\/asphalt, the tread doesn't help you and actually slightly reduces contact area and increases rolling resistance.  On most road tires the minimal tread pattern is just cosmetic to make their customers feel better (since a smooth tire looks slippery).\n\nSee also: Sheldon Brown's comments on tire replacement and tread patterns\nIf you plan to ride through mud, sand or other soft surfaces, you need tread.

{"conversations":["How to comfort a dying dog?","Although it is a natural part of life, it is never easy saying goodbye to your beloved canine companion. During this stage of life, you will want to make your dog as comfortable as possible. The comfort you provide throughout this potentially frightening situation will make the transition easier for your dog and bring you peace of mind as well.\n\n## Comfort your dog at home\n\n1. Stay patient with your dog. Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments. If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.\n2. Provide a quiet environment. Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you're trying to spend the final hours of your dog's life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house. Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water.\n3. Speak in comforting tones. Reassure your dog that he's not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him \u201cgood boy\u201d and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it's okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well. If you want to make sure you're there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights.\n4. Put down comfortable bedding. If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably. Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold. Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog. On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can't help it. If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.\n5. Keep fresh water available. Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn't have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water.\n6. Prepare some of his favorite meal. If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he's hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don't force him to eat if he's not hungry. Solid food may also upset your dog's stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A\/D diet, which is liquid.\n7. See your veterinarian about pain management. If your dog still has enough time and you're worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days. Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move.\n8. Hug your dog one final time. Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It's a very painful moment, so remember that it's perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could. Be aware that some dogs seem to \"move\" or \"take a breath\" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life. It's also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open. You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.\n9. Take care of yourself. Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps. The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n10. Handle your pet's remains. Though it's unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet's remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home. Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.\n\n\n## Comfort your dog at the vet\n\n1. Consult a professional about euthanasia. The ASPCA has a specific hotline for those dealing with the difficult decision of euthanizing a pet. The line gives you someone to talk to who will understand your grief throughout the process, as well as information about your dog's quality of life at this stage and whether or not euthanasia may be the most humane option. You can reach the ASPCA hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n2. Make the appointment. Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you'll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog's condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.\n3. Bring some of your dog's favorite items. You'll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes. Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he's already in discomfort.\n4. Sign any forms at the vet. When you sign in for the appointment, you'll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.\n5. Ask about a sedative beforehand. If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain.\n6. Pet your dog with gentle, loving strokes. Once you've been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.\n7. Hug your dog. Your vet will ensure you're ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths. Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing. The veterinarian's office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.\n8. Give yourself time. Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you're going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.\n9. Discuss options for the remains. After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog's remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not. In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":777}
{"conversations":["How to dress nice every day (for girls)?","Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.\n\n## Fill your wardrobe\n\n1. Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories. Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.\n2. Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don\u2019t normally wear or patterns that pop. For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.\n3. Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday. While you most likely can\u2019t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.\n4. Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes have cuts that look different on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:\n\t* If you have a \u2018Pear\u2019 shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist.\n5. Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn-out clothing does not necessarily look very classy\u2014unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans. If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.\n6. Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don\u2019t like a color or don\u2019t feel like it looks good on you, don\u2019t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing in things that make you confident and happy; if a certain color matches your skin tone, but you don\u2019t like it anyway, don\u2019t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:\n\t* Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens. Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange. Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples. Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds. Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.\n7. Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not sure how to iron your clothes, click here. You can also try steam pressing your clothes.\n\n\n## Plan your outfit\n\n1. Plan your outfits. One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week\u2019s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear. Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last-minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.\n2. Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you\u2019re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with maybe the way to go. If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.\n3. Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost. Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.\n4. Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy. For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.\n5. Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the \u2018rule of three\u2019 can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color. Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as a navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.\n6. Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to come up with this eye-catching ensemble.\n7. Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won\u2019t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit. By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.\n8. Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just don\u2019t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, it's important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\n\n## Accessorizing\n\n1. Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses. Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it\u2019s important to be able to walk in them.\n2. Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.\n3. Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well\u2014from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:\n\t* Shine shoes\n\t* Polish shoes\n\t* Wash shoes\n4. Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding. However, try not to over-accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.\n5. Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry can draw a person\u2019s eye, which can be both a great thing and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together. However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.\n6. Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.\n7. Create your own \u2018golden rule\u2019. The \u2018golden rule\u2019 refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit. Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn\u2019t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":730}

","Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":233}
{"conversations":["Can Romex (NM-B) cable be run through conduit?","Yes, NM (Romex) cable can be in conduit. In fact, National Electrical Code (NEC() calls for it to be in conduit, when protection from physical damage is required. But it really isn't worth it.\n\n## It's a nightmare to pull\nNM (Romex) is already solid wire except in the large sizes, and now you have 3-4 wires bound together. You are trying to pull this around maybe 14\" radius elbows, and if the NM gets twists in it (it always does), it really drags in those places. It's just a stiff, miserable pull - enough to \"put you off conduit forever\" - which is a shame, because conduit is wonderful when using easy-to-pull stranded wire.\n\nPulling this stiff cable increases the risk of damaging the cable. What's more, \"cable in conduit\" is often a newbie who chooses cable simply because he is unaware that wire comes in any other forms. Which leads to more risk of damage still.\n\n## It requires ridiculously large conduit\nYou still have to calculate and respect conduit fill rules, and those are very punishing toward cable. Most cable is oblong, and the rules say you use the largest dimension and treat it as a circular wire of that dimension.\n\n* For a single \"wire\", you are allowed 53% conduit fill. That means the conduit ID must be at least 137% of the large cross-section of the cable. That's not so bad, but...\n* For two \"wires\", you're only allowed 31% fill. That's to protect the wires from binding. That means the conduit ID must be at least 2.54 times the cable large dimension.\n* For three \"wires\", you're allowed 40% fill. That means the conduit must be at least 2.74 times the cable width (at 3 wires), larger for more wires.\n\nFor instance, someone wanted to squeeze three #6 cables through a 1\" conduit. Now this is \"easy peasy\" with 6 individual #6 THHN wires and 3 bare #10 grounds. However, with three #6 UF cables, the conduit size needed to be 3\" instead of 1\". Whoa.\n\nYou are certainly allowed to do it, but you will be using rather enormous conduit, and you will have a hard time pulling."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":189}

{"conversations":["How to thicken facial hair?","If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the patchiness of your beard or mustache, there are several easy steps you can take to thicken your facial hair. Many of these involve making simple lifestyle changes, like changing your diet or exercising more. If these easy techniques don\u2019t give you the results you\u2019re looking for, there are several products you can try out, which may either make your beard thicker or make it appear so. If these don\u2019t work and you really want fuller facial hair, there\u2019s always the option of getting a beard transplant.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Eat a healthy diet to get the vitamins and nutrients your beard needs. Like any other part of your body, your beard needs vitamins and nutrients to grow properly. Be sure your diet includes a balanced mix of whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables. Remember to also drink plenty of water and other fluids to stay hydrated. Since your hair is protein-based, it\u2019s especially important that you eat plenty of protein. Sources of protein include: lean meats, eggs, dairy products, beans, legumes, seeds, and nuts. Adult men should aim to consume around 0.84 grams (0.030 oz) of protein per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight.\n2. Exercise to help stimulate hair growth. Being physically active on a regular basis will help boost your blood circulation. Better blood circulation will allow more nutrients to reach your hair roots, helping to boost hair growth. Try to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise every day by jogging, taking a brisk walk, or riding a bike. If you don\u2019t exercise much, ease into an exercise regime gradually so that you don\u2019t injure yourself.\n3. Reduce stress in your life to keep your hair healthy. Constant, high levels of stress can make your hair more brittle and even cause it to fall out. You can minimize stress in your life by getting enough sleep every night, exercising regularly, and participating in relaxing activities. Aim to get between 8-10 hours of sleep a night if you\u2019re a teenager, and at least 7 hours of sleep if you\u2019re over 18 years of age. Activities like yoga, meditation, and reading can also help you relax.\n\n\n## Take care of your facial hair\n\n1. Let your beard grow for at least 4 weeks. You\u2019ll need to let your facial hair grow out a while before you can determine just how thick it looks. While your beard may look patchy and uneven after a week of letting it grow out, after 4 weeks, it may actually look lush and full. Try not to start trimming your beard too soon. Don\u2019t trim any hair until you reach the 3rd week or so. Itchiness usually fades after the 2nd week of growing out your facial hair.\n2. Comb and brush your facial hair to cover patchy spots. As you let your facial hair grow out, comb and brush it daily. Comb areas that are thicker towards the patchier areas you want to cover. This will help train the hairs to grow in that direction. If you plan to keep a beard long term, consider investing in a quality beard brush.\n3. Apply a beard oil to your beard to soften and nourish it. In addition to eating a healthy and well-balanced diet, using beard oil is another great way to supply your beard with the vitamins and nutrients it needs to look full and healthy. Apply beard oil to your facial hair once a day to begin with. Apply your beard oil soon after you get out of the shower, when your beard is still slightly damp, but not dripping wet. Beard oil will also help reduce the itchiness of your facial hair during the first 2 weeks of growth.\n\n\n## Use hair-growth products\n\n1. Dye your facial hair to make it look thicker. If some of your facial hairs are blond, light brown, or gray, your facial hair may look thinner and patchier than it really is. Dyeing your facial hair a darker color will make these hairs more visible, making your beard or mustache look fuller and more uniform. You can find hair dye made for coloring facial hair at your local drug store. When dyeing your facial hair, follow the directions on the container closely, so you don\u2019t end up with dye spots on your skin.\n2. Take biotin supplements daily to thicken your facial hair. Biotin supplements may help thicken your facial hair by strengthening your hair\u2019s keratin infrastructure, giving your facial hair a fuller appearance. You can find biotin supplements over-the-counter at your local drug store. Biotin supplements, unfortunately, won\u2019t make hair grow in places where there isn\u2019t any to begin with. Products marketed as beard-growing pills are usually a combination of biotin, vitamin C, zinc, and other vitamins. The claims of these and other supplements haven\u2019t been proven in clinical trials, so take them with a hefty grain of salt.\n3. Apply Minoxidil (aka Rogaine) to your facial hair. Minoxidil helps stimulates blood circulation, which allows more nutrients and hormones to reach your hair follicles. This helps encourage growth of your hair. You can buy Minoxidil as a foam or liquid. You can purchase Minoxidil at your local drug store. The 2 most common side-effects users of Minoxidil experience are lower blood pressure and dry, irritated skin.\n4. Look into getting a beard transplant if other methods don\u2019t work. A beard transplant involves a doctor taking hairs from the back of your scalp and transferring them to areas on your face where you want thicker hair. After the procedure, it may take a few months for you to see its final results. The procedure typically takes several hours and requires the application of a local anesthetic. A beard transplant can cost upwards of $7,000.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":787}

{"conversations":["Why can't MX records point to an IP address?","The whole idea behind the mail exchange (MX) record is to specify a host or hosts which can accept mail for a domain. As specified in RFC 1035, the MX record contains a domain name. It must therefore point to a host which itself can be resolved in the DNS. An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP\/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol. A single MX record can't possibly list more than one address, so the only option is to point to a host, where all of that host's addresses can then be looked up. (As a performance optimization, the DNS server will send along the address records for the host in the response additional section if it has authoritative records for them, saving a round trip.)\n\nThere is also the situation that arises when your mail exchangers are provided by a third party (e.g. Google Apps or Office 365). You point your MX records to their hostnames, but it may occur that the service provider needs to change the mail servers' IP addresses. Since you have pointed to a host, the service provider can do this transparently and you don't have to make any changes to your records."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":219}
{"conversations":["Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?","First off, I highly recommend the book Get a Financial Life. The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments. How you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself. Here is a good starting point."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":276}

While the advancement of science might have enabled hand-made instances of motorized vehicles for very wealthy individuals, the main mode of transportation for people would have remained foot, horse, or sail. \n\n*  Communication: The Industrial Revolution enabled the creation of power and communication infrastructures, which would not exist in an unindustrialized world, forcing people to communicate slowly via physical transportation of messages. \n\n*  Agriculture: Our timeline's population boom is supported by the ability to mass produce food. In an unindustrialized world, supporting a large global population would be impossible, and there would likely be substantially less humans alive than there are today. \n\n*  Education: Industrialization incentivized public education systems. In a pre-industrialized world, most people could not read. \n\n*  Global Warming: One negative aspect of the Industrial Revolution is that it eventually led to the climate crisis Earth faces today. \n\nHence, the world would still remain in a pre-modern state.

{"conversations":["I've come across the polynomial algorithm that solves 2SAT. I've found it boggling that 2SAT is in P where all (or many others) of the SAT instances are NP-Complete. What makes this problem different? What makes it so easy (NL-Complete - even easier than P)?","Here is a further intuitive and unpretentious explanation along the lines of MGwynne's answer.\nWith $2$-SAT, you can only express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b$, where $a$ and $b$ are literals. More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals. Now you are in trouble: if you set $a$ to true, then either $b$ or $c$ must be true, but which one? You have to make a choice: you have 2 possibilities. Here is where case-multiplication becomes possible, and where the combinatorial explosion arises.\nIn other words, $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility, while $2$-SAT doesn't have such ability. It is precisely such presence of more than one possibility ($2$ possibilities in case of $3$-SAT, $k-1$ possibilities in case of $k$-SAT) that causes the typical combinatorial explosion of NP-complete problems.

{"conversations":["Is it worth patenting an algorithm if I don't have the money to defend against infringements?","This is a great question, with no one right answer.\nThe strength of a patent comes from the ability to enforce it. If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":13}

{"conversations":["Temperature conversion:\n$$273 + \\text{degree Celsius} = \\text{Kelvin}$$\nActually why is that $273$? How does one come up with this?","One Celsius (or Kelvin) degree as a temperature difference was defined as 1\/100 of the temperature difference between the freezing point of water and boiling point of water. These points are called 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. The number 100 arose because we're used to numbers that are powers of ten because we use the base-ten system. The Celsius degree is \"one percent\" of the temperature difference.\n\nThere also exists the minimum temperature that one may achieve. In Kelvin degrees, it's sensible to call this minimum 0 K: that's a primary condition on the \"natural\" temperature scales such as the Kelvin scale. If one insists that one Kelvin degree is equally large as one Celsius degree as a unit of temperature difference, it just turns out that the melting point of ice has to be 273.15 K and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. It's because the temperature difference between the boiling and freezing points is 2.7315 times smaller than the temperature difference between the minimum allowed temperature, the absolute zero, and the freezing point of water.\n\nThe value 2.7315 cannot be easily explained in simple words. It represents a specific characteristic related to water, a natural phenomenon that arises from the principles of quantum mechanics. To understand this value, extensive simulations are required to analyze the behavior of water molecules across a wide range of temperatures. Through experimental evidence, we have confirmed that this value accurately reflects the properties of water.","Why people don't go to a logarithmic scale (kind of like decibels), at least for low temperatures. Then there would be no lower limit.","Exponential notation adequately handles temperatures that are sufficiently low. What is important is that temperature is just energy per degree of freedom and energy is additive, thus all nonlinear redefinitions of $T\\to f(T)$ would be unnatural. Also note that for the ideal gas, we have $pV=nRT$, so at a fixed pressure (or volume), the volume (or pressure) is proportional to $T$. We don't express pressures and volumes in terms of their logarithms, either, so it would be equally unnatural for the temperature.\n\nThe log scale is always a sort of \"policymaking issue\", making it easy for people to say simple numbers instead of powers of ten which are \"complicated constucts\" for most laymen. It's the only justification for decibels, pH, Richter scales, and other things: you just don't want the laymen to ever pronounce \"ten to the power of [a number]\", that's the only reason. But people achieved just a billionth of kelvin, that's the record, and those small numbers aren't extreme and one can express them in words like billionth without using \"ten to minus [a big power]\"."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1024}

Is there anything I can do to improve performance without reformatting the data outside of Emacs?","Emacs' handling of long lines is not very well optimized. For a number of operations, Emacs has to scan the whole line repeatedly. For example, to display a line, Emacs has to figure out the height of the line, which requires scanning the whole line to find the tallest glyph. Additionally, scanning for bidirectional display eats up a lot of time. You can get some additional information in, for example, the docstring of ```cache-long-line-scans``` (renamed ```cache-long-scans``` in 24.4).\n\nYou can try and see if setting ```bidi-paragraph-direction``` to ```left-to-right``` and setting ```bidi-inhibit-bpa``` (new in Emacs 27, see footnote 1) to ```t``` improves the speed for you (see footnote 2).

{"conversations":["How to make surf wax?","## Make warm water wax\n\n1. Heat water in a double broiler. Pour in about 1 \u00bd cups (354.8 ml) of water in the bottom of a double broiler. Heat on medium heat until the water is hot and steaming. You do not need to boil the water, you just need it to be hot enough to melt the beeswax through steaming. If you don't have a double broiler, you can also simply heat water in a pot on the stove, then put an equal sized pot on top of it to create the effect of a double broiler.\n2. Place the beeswax and coconut oil in the top of the double broiler. Once the water has heated and is steaming, place 1 cup (240 ml) of beeswax and \u00bc cup (60 ml) of coconut oil in the top pan of the double broiler. Place the top of the double broiler on top of the bottom pan.\n3. Melt the ingredients, stirring constantly. Once you place the beeswax and coconut oil over the bottom of the broiler, they should begin to melt. As they melt, stir the ingredients constantly so that they don't get stuck to the sides of the pan.\n4. Add in essential oils. If you want your wax to be fragrant, add a few of drops of essential oils when the wax and coconut oil have melted and mixed together. Popular oils to use are lavender, peppermint, lemon or rosemary. If you prefer the subtle scent of the coconut oil, don't add any essential oil.\n\n\n## Make cold water wax\n\n1. Find a healthy conifer. Cold-water wax differs from warm-water wax because it requires the addition of tree resin. To extract tree resin, first find a conifer tree that generally looks healthy, with relatively smooth, tight bark and without many dead branches or limbs. Conifer trees are trees that grow conifers, the cone-like growths that grow on tree branches. Examples of conifers are pine, spruce, maple and cedar trees. If you don't want to extract tree resin yourself, you can find it on Ebay or other online sites.\n2. Create a flat, cleared area on the face of the tree. Once you have found a suitable tree, use a machete or a hatchet to cut downward on the bark about 3 feet from the ground. Make a rectangle that is about 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Try to cut cleanly so that you cut out a flat area about 1 inch deep into the tree.\n3. Place a bucket under the tree. Place a bucket against the tree directly underneath where you made the rectangular indent. Use a flat piece of metal or another smooth material to make a ramp that leads from the cleared rectangle into the bucket. The ramp will catch the resin as it comes out of the tree and lead it into the bucket. Therefore, it's important that the ramp is flush against the tree and leads directly into the bucket.\n4. Cut V-shaped notches into the cleared rectangle. After you set up the bucket, use the hatchet or machete to hack into the cleared rectangle you made, forming V-shaped notches that are about half an inch from each other. It may be easier to do one side of the \u201cV\u201d at a time, hacking downward slashes on the left half of the rectangle and then hacking upward slashes on the other side of the rectangle.\n5. Check the bucket every day. Collecting tree resin isn't instantaneous. You may have to wait several days for enough resin to collect. Keep the bucket under the tree and check on it daily. When it looks like you have about \u00bc cup of resin, remove the bucket from the tree and transfer the resin to a small bowl. It should take two to three days to collect \u00bc cup (60 ml) of resin.\n6. Use a double broiler to melt ingredients and form the wax. Use the same steps used to make cold-water wax, adding in the additional ingredient of \u00bc cup (60 ml) of tree resin along with the beeswax and coconut oil in the top of the double broiler. The resulting wax will have a slightly stickier consistency than warm-water wax.\n\n\n## Put the wax in containers\n\n1. Pour the wax into a tin or container. Once the ingredients of the warm or cold water wax have fully mixed together, pour the wax into a container or tin large enough to fit it. Scrape the sides of the pan to be sure to get out all the wax. Use a tin or container that has a top so that the wax won't dry out.\n2. Let the surf wax harden. Before you close the container of surf wax, leave the wax out to harden for three to four hours or overnight. Leaving the container open lets the heat escape so that the wax can harden faster, and so its consistency stays the same.\n3. Use the wax or close and store the container. After the wax has hardened, it is ready for use. When you are done using the wax, place the lid on the container and store it in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":770}

The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server\/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":284}

{"conversations":["I'm interested in Japanese politics. Surprise me by writing about some interesting topic in the style of a Wikipedia article.","Japanese politics is a fascinating topic.

The Constitution came into effect on 3 May 1947, following the surrender of Japan in World War II. In its text, the state formally renounces the sovereign right of belligerency and aims at an international peace based on justice and order. The article also states that, to accomplish these aims, armed forces with war potential will not be maintained. The Constitution was imposed by the occupying United States (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) in the post-World War II period.\n\nThere are the post-occupation U.S. military stationed in Japan under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty and Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) which was founded in 1954 as de facto postwar Japanese military. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved a reinterpretation which gave more powers to the JSDF in 2014, which was made official in 2015.\n\n##Text of the article\n\nThe full text of the article in Japanese:\n> \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u61b2\u6cd5\n> \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u3000\u6226\u4e89\u306e\u653e\u68c4\n> \u7b2c\u4e5d\u6761\u3000\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u6c11\u306f\u3001\u6b63\u7fa9\u3068\u79e9\u5e8f\u3092\u57fa\u8abf\u3068\u3059\u308b\u56fd\u969b\u5e73\u548c\u3092\u8aa0\u5b9f\u306b\u5e0c\u6c42\u3057\u3001\u56fd\u6a29\u306e\u767a\u52d5\u305f\u308b\u6226\u4e89\u3068\u3001\u6b66\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5a01\u5687\u53c8\u306f\u6b66\u529b\u306e\u884c\u4f7f\u306f\u3001\u56fd\u969b\u7d1b\u4e89\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6bb5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u6c38\u4e45\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3092\u653e\u68c4\u3059\u308b\u3002\n> \u2461\u3000\u524d\u9805\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u3092\u9054\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9678\u6d77\u7a7a\u8ecd\u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u6226\u529b\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4fdd\u6301\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002\u56fd\u306e\u4ea4\u6226\u6a29\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u8a8d\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\nThe official English translation of the article is:\n> ARTICLE 9. (1) Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\n> (2) In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be sustained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\n\n##Historical background\n\nThe failure of the collective security of the League of Nations led to the realization that a universal system of security could only be effective if nations agreed to some limitation of their national sovereignty with regard to their right to belligerency, and if the Security Council which had been a \"closed shop\" during League of Nations times, would open itself up to UN Members who would cede constitutional powers in favor of collective security. Article 9 was added to the 1947 constitution during the occupation following the defeat of Japan in World War II.\n\nThe source of the pacifist clause is disputed. According to the Allied Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur (in statements made at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to re-arm), the provision was suggested by Prime Minister Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, who \"wanted it to prohibit any military establishment for Japan\u2014any military establishment whatsoever\". Shidehara's perspective was that retention of arms would be \"meaningless\" for the Japanese in the post-war era, because any substandard post-war military would no longer gain the respect of the people, and would actually cause people to obsess with the subject of rearming Japan.\n\nThe House of Representatives amended the Article and added \u201cAspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order,\u201d to Paragraph 1 and \u201cIn order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph,\u201d to Paragraph 2. Hitoshi Ashida made this tenor. Many scholars think the Government of Japan does not renounce the right (to have power) of self-defense because of this amendment.\n\nThe article was endorsed by the Imperial Diet of Japan on 3 November 1946. Kades later made statements, like MacArthur at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to rearm, that suggested he had initially rejected the proposed language that prohibited Japan's use of force \"for its own security\", believing that self-preservation was the right of every nation. The historical record, however, casts doubt on this revisionist interpretation.\n\n##Interpretation\n\nSoon after the adoption of the Constitution of Japan on 3 May 1947, the Chinese Civil War ended in victory for the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a consequence, the United States was left without the Republic of China (ROC) on Mainland China as a military ally against communism in the Pacific. There was a desire on the part of the United States occupation forces for Japan to take a more active military role in the struggle against communism during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was pulled out of Japan and sent to fight on the front lines in Korea, and so Japan was left without any armed protection. MacArthur ordered the creation of a 75,000-strong National Police Reserve (\u8b66\u5bdf\u4e88\u5099\u968a, Keisatsu yobitai) to maintain order in Japan and repel any possible invasion from outside. The NPR was organized by United States Army Col. Frank Kowalski (later a U.S. congressman) using Army surplus equipment. To avoid possible constitutional violations, military items were given civilian names: tanks, for instance, were named \"special vehicles\".\n\nOn 1 August 1952, a new National Safety Agency (\u4fdd\u5b89\u5e81, Hoancho) was formed to supervise the NPR and its maritime component. In 1954, the National Safety Agency became the Japan Defense Agency (now Ministry of Defense), and the National Police Reserve became the Japan Self-Defense Forces (\u81ea\u885b\u968a, Jieitai). In practice, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are very well equipped and the maritime forces are considered to be stronger than the navies of some of Japan's neighbors. The Supreme Court of Japan has reinforced the constitutionality of armed self-defense in several major rulings, most notably the Sunakawa Case of 1959, which upheld the legality of the then-current U.S.\u2013Japan Security Treaty.\n\n##Debate\n\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan is best understood as having three distinct elements: (1) a provision that prohibits the use of force (paragraph one); (2) a provision that prohibits the maintenance of armed forces or \"other war potential\" (paragraph two, clause one); and (3) a denial of the rights of belligerency. It is helpful to keep these distinct elements in mind in considering the operation and effect of Article 9. Paragraph one, which prohibits the use of force has been highly effective in constraining Japanese foreign policy, with the result that Japan has not used force or been engaged in armed conflict since the promulgation of the Constitution.\n\nDespite the fading of bitter wartime memories, the general public, according to opinion polls, continued to show strong support for this constitutional provision.\n\nThe different views can be clearly organized into four categories:\n* The current **pacifists** believe in maintaining Article 9 and claim the JSDF is unconstitutional, and would like to detach Japan from international wars. A stricter interpretation could also include peacekeeping operations.\n* The **mercantilists** have divided opinions about Article 9 although the interpretation is broadened to include the JSDF, and believe that the JSDF's role should be retained to activities related to the United Nations and for non-combat purposes. They advocate minimal defense spending, and emphasize economic growth.\n* The **normalists** \"call for incremental armament for national defense and accept using military force to maintain international peace and security\". They support the revision of Article 9 to include a clause explaining the existence and function of the JSDF.\n* The **nationalists** assert that Japan should remilitarize and build nuclear capabilities in order to regain pride and independence. They also advocate revision or, in extreme cases, the repeal and abolishment of Article 9 to promote renewed rearmament."],"source":"authors","idx":496}

If you notice a lot of temp ups \/ downs in the area you are gardening than it is probably worth moving the garden or choosing another spot.  With apartments that becomes all the more difficult.\n\nYour plant also probably came from some nice greenhouse, an english gardens, a ray weigands, etc etc...They have plenty of light, they also have plenty of means of water and the temperature well most of this is all outside, so they have the advantage of using mother nature.

{"conversations":["Why is it hard to draw people running in animes?","The walk cycle is considered to be one of the most basic aspects of animation. American animators and animation enthusiasts often times scorn the Japanese styles and methods of animation as lazy, while Japanese anime enthusiasts deride the American style as clunky or too comical.\n\nWhy is that you ask? The answer lies in how these countries distribute their budget and time. \n\nWhile American animation often times may seem lacking in it's attention to detail, it makes up for it the quality of their animation. American animation often times meticulous and original in how they animate motion, though sometimes content is reused cyclically, the animation is painstakingly frame by frame. \n\nIn contrast, Japanese anime uses a lot of shortcuts (to save budget and meet deadlines). Typically long scenes feature only the mouth of a character (and maybe other minor features like a waving hair or glittering eyes) moving during delivery of key information\/dialog, or the short burst of motion of some character in some an action pose against an animated, cyclic, and stylized background (I'm looking at you transformation scenes). Often times these uses of dramatic still-shots are done against patterned (or static illustrated) backgrounds, sometimes a few moving emotive icons (sweat drops, question marks, small chibi animated heads) will accompany a some sort of monologue. Admittedly both styles of animation reuse shots and sequences, but it's more noticeable in Japanese anime for various reason (e.g., not enough budget and\/or manpower). This is why Japanese anime is typically labeled as \"lazy\" by American animators and enthusiasts.\n\nA typical walk cycle in animation consists of 8 keyframes typically:\n\nThe smoothness of an animation is typically determined by the framerate and amount of key frames in the animation. \nIn American animation, the animation is captured by shooting two frames of film per drawing at a rate of 24 frames per second (fps) to achieve the smooth motion of American animation. \nJapanese anime, while it also runs at an average 24 fps, typically captures their animation at a rate of three or four frames per drawing in order to save money and manpower. Though it varies depending on the studio and tools used (e.g 3DCG) with main objects in the foreground (typically characters) are animated at 8 to 12 fps, while background objects can be animated at as low as 6 to 8 fps.\n\nLets compare the difference between one walk cycle that is 8 frame to one that is 16 frames, both at 60 fps:\n  \nNotice the 16 frame one is smoother, but slower while the 8 frame is faster, but choppier. This is because it takes the 16 frame animation twice as long, covering more frames, to go through one cycle than the 8 frame one.\nThe varying of frame rates can also be be used to depict the expansion and compression of time (think bullet time from The Matrix). However generally choppy animation is the result of not enough keyframes in your animation. More frames mean more and manpower and\/or time, which ultimately means more money is required. Japanese anime production don't typically have as big of a budget compared to American productions (but there are exceptions), so they must make do with what they have and cut corners where they can (like Shaft did with the certain Bakemonogatari TV episodes)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":232}

Any thoughts?","As serialization doesn't work generally (only when the order of properties matches: ```JSON.stringify({a:1,b:2}) !== JSON.stringify({b:2,a:1})```) you have to check the count of properties and compare each property as well:\n\n```const objectsEqual = (o1, o2) =>\n    Object.keys(o1).length === Object.keys(o2).length\n        && Object.keys(o1).every(p => o1[p] === o2[p]);\nconst obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 33};\nconst obj2 = { age: 33, name: 'John' };\nconst obj3 = { name: 'John', age: 45 };\nconsole.log(objectsEqual(obj1, obj2)); \/\/ true\nconsole.log(objectsEqual(obj1, obj3)); \/\/ false```\n\nIf you need a deep comparison, you can call the function recursively:\n\n```const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 33, info: { married: true, hobbies: ['sport', 'art'] } };\nconst obj2 = { age: 33, name: 'John', info: { hobbies: ['sport', 'art'], married: true } };\nconst obj3 = { name: 'John', age: 33 };\nconst objectsEqual = (o1, o2) =>\n    typeof o1 === 'object' && Object.keys(o1).length > 0\n        ?

{"conversations":["Given that Kohn-Sham DFT is strictly a ground-state method (at 0 K), how is it sufficient to describe materials in real-life applications?","These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":125}
{"conversations":["How to stop the spread of a pandemic flu virus?","## Prevention\n\n1. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a disposable tissue and flush it down the toilet or throw it in a trash can immediately (don't put it down on any surface). Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer right afterwards. If you don't have anything to cough or sneeze into, cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow rather than your hand. Change your clothing (if you were wearing long sleeves) or wash your arm as soon as you can. Carry tissues with you and offer them to others.\n2. Keep your hands clean. Wash your hands throughout the day, especially after touching other people or any surface that others have touched. Carry alcohol-based sanitizer with you. Offer it to others. Avoid touching your face unless your hands are just cleaned.\n3. Don't share utensils or drinks. In cafeteria settings, it's not uncommon for people to casually share utensils or take a sip from someone else's drink. This should be completely avoided if there is any risk of a flu pandemic.\n4. Wear a face mask or respirator as instructed by authorities. If used correctly, face masks and respirators may help prevent some exposure to flu viruses. However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.\n5. Stay healthy. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. The healthier you are, the better your immune system will be at defending your body against a virus.\n\n\n## Preparation\n\n1. Know what to expect. A vaccine for pandemic flu may not be available for 4-6 months after a pandemic starts, and even then, it may only be available in limited amounts. People will have little or no immunity to pandemic flu since it is a new virus to humans. With seasonal flu, people have some immunity built up from previous exposure to the viruses. Symptoms of pandemic flu may be more severe than seasonal flu. More people are likely to die from pandemic flu than from seasonal flu.\n2. Stock up. Store nonperishable foods, bottled water, over-the-counter drugs, health supplies, and other necessities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends having a 2-week supply. (These supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages.) Have basic, over-the-counter health supplies such as a thermometer, facemasks, tissues, soap, hand sanitizers, medicine to relieve fever, and cold medicine.\n3. Plan ahead. Plan for what you will do in the following cases:\n\t* Schools dismissed: Consider childcare needs. Plan home learning activities and exercises. Have materials, such as books, on hand. Also plan recreational activities that your children can do at home. You or family member becomes sick and requires care: Make plans for how to care for people with special needs in case the services they rely on are not available. Plan to stay home for at least 10 days when you are sick with pandemic flu. Staying home will keep you from giving it to others. Make sure others in your household also stay home when they are sick. During a severe pandemic, stay home if someone in your household is sick with pandemic flu. Transportation networks disrupted. Think about how you can rely less on public transportation during a pandemic. For example, store food and other essential supplies so you can make fewer trips to the store. Prepare backup plans for taking care of loved ones who are far away. Consider other ways to get to work, or, if you can, work at home.\n4. Talk to your employer. Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. You can Develop a Risk Management Plan that accounts for the possibility of a flu pandemic. Find out if you can work from home, or if your employer will consider virtualizing the workforce. Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed. Check with your employer or union about leave policies.\n5. Stay updated. Identify sources you can count on for reliable information. If a pandemic occurs, having accurate and reliable information will be critical. Reliable, accurate, and timely information is available at http:\/\/www.pandemicflu.gov. Another source for information on pandemic influenza is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hotline at: 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). This line is available in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY: 1-888-232-6348. If you do not live in the U.S., check if there is an equivalent hotline in your area. Look for information on your local and state government Web sites. Review your state's planning efforts and those of your local public health and emergency preparedness officials. Listen to local and national radio, watch news reports on television, and read your newspaper and other sources of printed and Web-based information.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":749}
{"conversations":["How do DOS games like DOOM benefit from a PCI graphics card?","DOOM itself doesn\u2019t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for \u201cVGA compatible\u201d adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I\/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there\u2019s a specific \u201cVGA compatible controller\u201d device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and\/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn\u2019t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can\u2019t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics \u2014 for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn\u2019t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE\/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard\u2019s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn\u2019t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":10}

Job requirements: If your job has built-in workplace hazards, especially for pregnant employees (i.e. it\u2019s particularly strenuous or exposes you to harmful chemicals), it's better to have an early conversation with your boss to discuss any necessary changes in duties or seek a transfer to ensure your safety and well-being.\n\n4. Upcoming reviews: If you're afraid your announcement might influence the results of an upcoming performance or salary review, you may want to wait until after the review is completed before sharing the news.\n\n5. Company Culture: Try to gauge your boss's attitude toward family by discreetly gathering information from coworkers about their experiences. If you believe your boss (or company) may not be supportive, you may want to wait until the 20-week mark to announce your pregnancy. On the other hand, if your company offers special benefits such as flexible working hours, consider sharing the news as soon as you feel comfortable to take advantage of those benefits.","What to do if my boss treats me differently after I tell him?","After informing your boss about your pregnancy, be sure to keep your employer in the loop about your physical needs and limitations as your pregnancy progresses. If you experience differential treatment due to your pregnancy, it is essential to address the issue promptly. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Document the discrimination: If your boss does treat you differently because you're expecting, report the incidents of discrimination in writing to your HR department. Be sure to include details such as the date, time, who you spoke to and what transpired. \n\n2. Escalate to the EEOC: If your HR department ignores or does not fully address your complaint, file a charge of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Filing a charge with the EEOC is an important step in seeking resolution, not only for yourself but also for other pregnant individuals who may face similar challenges.\n\n3. Legal challenges: It's important to note that proving discrimination in court can be challenging. Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), you must show that a coworker who's not pregnant but has comparable temporary limitations got better treatment than you did. It can strengthen your case by taking detailed notes with dates of how your employer treats you versus other employees who've asked for temporary accommodations.\n\nThe good news is that more people are aware of pregnancy discrimination in the U.S. now than ever before, and women have won discrimination lawsuits. Remember, seeking resolution for pregnancy discrimination is not only important for your own well-being but also for fostering a fair and inclusive workplace environment for all pregnant individuals."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1004}

Besides prettier plots and the Manipulate function, do we have something that is useful for ML that other languages are lacking?","Mathematica doesn't have the depth of algorithm support that is present in R or Python. Julia has much more limited algorithm support but does exhibit a good turn of speed.\nThe few algorithms that Mathematica does support are not particularly well exposed for the type of tweaking needed to win Kaggle competitions.\nMathematica, as of version 10, supports the following classifiers:  \"LogisticRegression\", \"Markov\", \"NaiveBayes\", \"NearestNeighbors\", \"NeuralNetwork\", \"RandomForest\", \"SupportVectorMachine\".  \nWhilst it does offer one ensemble method, RandomForest, it lacks both Bagging and any flavour of boosting, such as Adaboost.

This limits significantly the potential for creating novel methods within the existing machine learning framework. \nMathematica's strengths lay with it's expressive, compact, language, strong visualisation capabilities and easy parallelization.

{"conversations":["So I'm pretty far into writing my dystopian novel and I was reading over what I had.  Something that helps me when I first start a novel is to get a clear picture of my characters in my head and put a face to a name, so I usually sculpt a personality and find a Google image of someone who I think matches that, and I put all of those into documents for my personal reference.  I looked over my main five characters--Analise, Poet, Shove, Star, and Nova--and then suddenly something jumped out at me.  Analise is Hispanic, Shove is Japanese, and Poet, Star, and Nova are all black.\nI had forgotten about their races because it wasn't important to me and I had not noticed while I was writing, because the story isn't about their racial backgrounds.  But is it, I don't know, somehow alienating or offensive to white readers that the characters aren't white, and that no main characters are white?   ","The answer I'll give you here is the same as the ones I've already given you and others: write what works for you. If these are who the characters are, then that's who they are. If you're forcing diversity, then it will come off as forced. That includes making some characters white just to be diverse.\n\nWill you alienate or even offend some white readers?  Yes.\n\nBut this is not the type of offense to worry about. Some people are so used to being in the mainstream everywhere and for everything, that they loudly protest when suddenly they're not. If they don't like your story, they can go literally anyplace else to find beautiful, stirring, authentic depictions of all sorts of white people. Even within works about people of color.\n\nSome people will argue that this is exactly the same as novels only including white people. But, no. It isn't. Because representation isn't just about a single work. It's about the entirety of our culture. Americans (and most Westerners) find white people so central to their understanding of the universe that they insert them in places they might not otherwise be and tell entire stories set in nonwhite worlds from the white character's point of view. (I just watched The Last King of Scotland which does exactly this...they invented a white character for this very purpose...in a movie about real events in Uganda.)\n\nWrite the story that matters to you."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":318}
{"conversations":["Is it ever possible that ```(a== 1 && a ==2 && a==3)``` could evaluate to true in JavaScript?","If you take advantage of how == works, you could simply create an object with a custom ```toString``` (or ```valueOf```) function that changes what it returns each time it is used such that it satisfies all three conditions.\n```\nconst a = {\n  i: 1,\n  toString: function () {\n    return a.i++;\n  }\n}\n\nif(a == 1 && a == 2 && a == 3) {\n  console.log('Hello World!');\n}\n```\n\nThe reason this works is due to the use of the loose equality operator. When using loose equality, if one of the operands is of a different type than the other, the engine will attempt to convert one to the other. In the case of an object on the left and a number on the right, it will attempt to convert the object to a number by first calling ```valueOf``` if it is callable, and failing that, it will call ```toString```. I used ```toString``` in this case simply because it's what came to mind, ```valueOf``` would make more sense. If I instead returned a string from ```toString```, the engine would have then attempted to convert the string to a number giving us the same end result, though with a slightly longer path."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":272}
{"conversations":["How to cook corn?","There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":629}

{"conversations":["How to do the rumba?","The rumba is a Latin dance that is popular all over the world. It's so simple to learn and can be danced to lots of music. Traditionally rumba uses latin music, but a lot of pop songs have the perfect tempo and rhythm, too! Learn to lead the steps, or follow your partner if you aren't as coordinated. Once you get the basic steps down, rumba gives you the freedom to groove with the music!\n\n## Position your body\n\n1. Clasp hands with your partner with elbows at a 90 degree angle. As the leader, raise your left hand. As the follower, raise your right hand. Keep your elbow close to your partner\u2019s elbow and almost touching it. Make sure your arm stays up and at a strict angle.\n2. Place your other hand behind your partner\u2019s shoulder. If you are the leader, put your right hand behind follower\u2019s left shoulder. If you are the follower, put your left hand behind the leader\u2019s right shoulder. Keep your arm straight and close against your partner\u2019s arm.\n3. Start with your feet close together side-by-side. When you are in position with your partner, make sure that both of you keep your feet close together side-by-side. You\u2019ll move your feet apart and back together as you perform the steps, so it\u2019s important that they are tight together when you start.\n4. Center your body and weight over the balls of your feet. Rumba requires quick, decisive movements, so always stay on the balls of your feet. Make sure you don\u2019t lean forward, backward, or sideways. As you perform the steps, keep yourself balanced.\n5. Maintain eye contact. You must stay in sync with your partner, and keeping your eyes locked is the best way to do it. Don't watch your feet or look around the room, or you are likely to lose the rhythm of your partner. Keeping eye contact helps you focus on the steps rather than on your surroundings.If your partner is not the same height as you, work together to split the height difference. Each of you should tilt your head either up or down so your eyes meet in the middle.\n\n\n## Lead the rumba\n\n1. Take a slow step straight forward with your left foot. Slide your foot gently forward, as opposed to lifting your foot off the ground and stomping down. Count two beats with the music when you take the first step. Keep the step light and stay on the ball of your foot. When you\u2019re a beginner, it\u2019s helpful to count the beats for each step of the rumba. Count the steps as either 1-2 (first step\/fourth step), 3 (second step\/fifth step) , 4 (third step\/sixth step) or as slow-quick-quick. Since your partner will mirror this step by stepping back, it\u2019s important to monitor their speed so you don\u2019t step on their foot.\n2. Step your right foot at a 45 degree angle away from its starting point. This step starts your body moving to the side, as your first step started moving you forward. Your feet should end up being shoulder width apart and directly in line from left to right. This step lasts one beat and your next step follows immediately, so be ready for another quick step. Keep your toes pointing forward when you set your foot down.\n3. Slide your left foot so it\u2019s next your right foot. Close the gap between your feet with this third step. This is a quick step that lasts one beat. When you finish the step, your feet should almost be touching. Make sure your weight is centered over both feet once again. You don\u2019t actually want to slide your foot along the ground, but only lift it enough to move it. You\u2019ll slow your step down if you lift it too high off of the ground. Quickly make any minor adjustments to your or your partner\u2019s position as you move into the second phase of the steps.\n4. Step backward slowly with your right foot. Move your right foot backward so it\u2019s roughly in line with where you started. Plant the ball of your foot and then lower your heel to the ground. Make sure this step lasts for two beats. The next step follows quickly, so make sure you are balanced on your right foot.\n5. Slide your left foot diagonally back to where it started. Take this step quickly so that it lasts one beat. Make sure your feet are shoulder width apart in a straight line. In the basic box step, your left foot should be in the same place it started. Shift the weight slightly onto your left foot in preparation for the next step.\n6. Close the gap between your feet by stepping with your right foot. Make this step quickly so that it only lasts for one beat. You are back where you started with your feet close together. Check that your weight is centered and distributed evenly between both feet. If you performed the steps correctly, the entire process takes eight beats. This should be two measures of music.\n\n\n## Follow the leader\n\n1. Step back slowly with your right foot. As the follower, mirror your partner\u2019s steps as closely as possible. At the same time that they move their left foot forward, your right foot must go backward. Match the distance that they step so your feet are as close as they were to start. This step lasts two beats. Be sure to step at the same speed as your partner.\n2. Step quickly at a backward diagonal with your left foot. As your partner steps diagonally with their right foot, mirror the step backwards. This step lasts for one beat, so you must step quickly. If you step too slowly, your partner may kick your foot when they step forward. End this step with your feet shoulder width apart, and with neither foot farther forward or backward. Shift your weight onto your left foot so you are ready for the next step.\n3. Slide your right foot toward your left foot quickly. Barely lift your right foot off of the ground, and plant it next to your left foot. Make this step at the same time as your partner so you move sideways together. You should be standing at a 45 degree angle from your starting spot. Make sure your weight is centered over your feet.\n4. Move your left foot forward slowly. As your partner moves back in the second phase, you move forward. Mirror their right foot moving backward with your left foot moving forward. Imagine your foot is pulled by their foot. Go slowly so this step takes two beats to accomplish. Be sure to shift your weight onto that left foot so you are ready to take the next step.\n5. Take a quick step with your right foot at 45 degrees forward. Move your feet back to parallel with this step. Make sure they are still shoulder width apart and directly across from your partner\u2019s feet. Be sure to step quickly so it takes one beat. Shift your weight slightly onto your right foot as you prepare to take the final step.\n6. Slide your left foot toward your right foot into its original place. Take this final step quickly and in time with your partner. Your feet end up close together and on the same place on the floor that they started.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":694}
{"conversations":["How to replace a ceramic tap cartridge?","## Choose a new cartridge and drain the faucet\n\n1. Purchase a cartridge that matches your faucet\u2019s model. The cartridge varies depending on the faucet you have, so getting an identical replacement is important. Order a new cartridge by noting the manufacturer\u2019s name and the faucet\u2019s model number. The name is usually printed somewhere on the faucet handle. The model number can sometimes be found on the faucet as well, such as on a tag tied to the cold water line. The water lines are located underneath the sink for a sink faucet and in the wall for a showerhead. They won\u2019t always be accessible, so look in the owner\u2019s manual for the model number as well. If you are unable to find the information you need to get a replacement, pull the cartridge out first, then take it with you to a hardware store. New cartridges can also be ordered online from the manufacturer.\n2. Turn the water control valve clockwise to shut off the water flow. If you\u2019re replacing a sink faucet, check underneath the sink. Look for a pair of water lines running from the handle, each with its own valve. If that isn\u2019t an option, locate the main shut-off valve in your home instead. It will be on the lowest floor of your home, close to the water heater. If you\u2019re having a hard time finding the valves, follow the water lines. For example, find where the main water line enters your home. Follow it to the water meter and the shut-off valve. The main shut-off valve can vary. It could be a colored wheel that you rotate or a handle that you position horizontally to stop the water flow. It may also be outside of your home.\n3. Open the faucet to release any water still inside it. Go back to the faucet you are replacing and activate it. If the water has been shut off, it won\u2019t shoot out its normal jet of water. Instead, any water trapped in the line will spill out. Wait until the faucet stops gurgling and dripping before attempting to replace the cartridge. Draining the line won\u2019t take long. The lines can\u2019t store much water, so they clear within several seconds.\n4. Cover the drain to prevent anything from falling down it. Faucets have some small screws and other parts that could cause a lot of unnecessary hassle if they were to get lost. To prevent accidents, fit the drain\u2019s plug into place. If it doesn\u2019t have a plug, place a towel over it. Make sure the drain is completely covered. Anything that falls down the drain will be difficult to remove and could damage your plumbing. If you happen to lose a part, order a replacement online or from a hardware store.\n\n\n## Handle a sink faucet\n\n1. Pry off the faucet cap with a flathead screwdriver. The decorative cap is at the very top of the faucet stem. Find the bottom edge of the cap, then slide the tip of the screwdriver underneath it. Push the cap up until it pops off the faucet. If the cap is stuck, pry it at a few different angles. Keep working around the edges until it is loose enough to lift off the faucet. Note that every handle is separate. If your faucet has separate cold and hot water handles, they have their own cartridges. Single-handle faucets only have one cartridge.\n2. Unscrew the handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Check the top of the faucet. There will be a small hole in the center where the cap was. Stick a small Phillips screwdriver into the hole to reach the screw, then turn it counterclockwise until you are able to remove it. Pull the faucet handles off afterward. Some faucets open with an Allen wrench instead. If the screw has a hexagonal opening on top, use an Allen wrench.\n3. Remove the nut on the faucet with a crescent wrench. Removing the handle exposes a circular metal nut on the base of the faucet. Clamp the wrench around the nut, then turn it counterclockwise. Once the nut comes loose, you can finish turning it by hand. Continue rotating it until you\u2019re able to lift it off of the faucet. You could also use pliers to remove the nut. Water pump pliers are designed for dealing with plumbing nuts and bolts, but you may be able to remove it with different tools.\n4. Pull the cartridge out of the faucet by hand. The only thing left in the faucet is the cartridge. It has a wide base with a metal or plastic column in the center. You can use the column to get a grip on the cartridge. Just pull it straight up from the faucet to remove it. The old cartridge can be thrown out in the trash. Cartridges have traditionally been made of brass, recognizable because of its dull yellow coloring. Your faucet may have a silvery cartridge made of chrome or zinc, or a white one made of plastic. If you\u2019re having a hard time holding onto the cartridge, grab it with pliers. Needle nose pliers are great for such delicate work.\n5. Insert the new cartridge into the faucet stem. The new cartridge won\u2019t fit unless it aligns with the stem slot properly. Check the bottom edge of the cartridge for a small tab. The inner part of the faucet stem will have a matching slot. Simply align the tab with the slot and slide the cartridge in to install it. Make sure the new cartridge is properly aligned with the opening so it you don\u2019t inadvertently damage it. Handle it with care!\n6. Reassemble the remaining handle parts to finish the installation. Put the parts back in reverse order. Start with the nut, tightening it by rotating it clockwise with a wrench once it\u2019s on the faucet stem. Place the handle on top of it, inserting and tightening its screw with a Phillips screwdriver. Finish by pressing the cap onto the top of the handle. If your faucet is connected to multiple handles, remember to replace the cartridge in the other handle as well if necessary. Once you have finished, reactivate the water line to test out the new cartridge!\n\n\n## Fix a shower faucet\n\n1. Unscrew the shower handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Rotate the handle until you spot a small opening with a screw inside. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Once the screw is gone, the handle won\u2019t have anything holding it to the wall. Slide it off the wall and set it aside. The cartridge is located behind the handle, so you won\u2019t be able to reach it without removing the handle first. Some shower handles have alternative types of screws. You may need an Allen wrench instead of a Phillips screwdriver.\n2. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the handle adapter. The handle is held in place by a round plate with an adapter in the middle. In the center of the adapter, you will see a screw. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Then, slide the adapter forward to detach it from the faceplate. Sometimes the adapter can be removed by twisting it off. It depends on the model, but, if you don\u2019t see a screw, you most likely have to twist it off. Note that you may need to remove the faceplate in some cases. It usually isn\u2019t necessary, but every cartridge system is a little different. If you don\u2019t see the cartridge, check the faceplate to see if it can be unscrewed too.\n3. Slip off the stem cover and anything else in front of the cartridge. Removing the adapter will reveal a small metal cylinder in the center of the wall opening. However, many shower cartridge systems have a few extra layers of protection around it. Yours may have a white plastic cap, followed by a metal ring. Pull both of them off the cartridge by hand and set them aside. These components are for adjusting and limiting the water temperature. They aren\u2019t present in all faucet models, but save them if you have them.\n4. Use pliers to pull out the clip holding the cartridge in place. Look along the top edge of the cartridge for the clip. It is usually made of steel and situated in a groove on the cartridge. Reach in with a pair of needle nose pliers, then lift it to pop it out of the slot. Pull it toward you to remove it, then dispose of it in the trash. Some faucets have a nut instead of a clip. If you see a ring around the cartridge but no clip, use pliers or a wrench to turn the nut counterclockwise. Once it comes loose, slide it off the wall.\n5. Remove the cartridge by gripping it with a pair of pliers. Once everything else is out of the way, the cartridge isn\u2019t tough to remove. Grip the stem, then attempt to pull it toward you. If it doesn\u2019t come out right away, take a closer look at it. Some cartridges have to be rotated slightly to align with a slot in the wall before they can be removed. The cartridge is recognizable because of its column-like stem jutting out from the wall. The cartridge\u2019s base is round and fits inside the wall opening. The cartridge is usually made of brass, which has a yellow coloring. Some cartridges are made of silvery steel or white plastic instead.\n6. Install the new cartridge by aligning it with the wall opening. Check the cartridge stem to see if it has a notch on it. If the notch is present, align it with the groove in the wall slot. Then, slide the cartridge in with pliers or a wrench. Make sure it is plugged all the way in before putting anything else on top of it. If the new cartridge came with a packet of grease, rub it onto the cartridge before putting it back. The grease protects the cartridge from damage during the installation. You could also apply your own plumber\u2019s grease to it.\n7. Replace the remaining parts to finish the installation. Replace the parts one by one in reverse order from how you took them out. Start with the retaining clip or nut, tightening it after putting it back. Return any stem coverings next, followed by the screw-on handle adapter. When you\u2019re done, add the handle and screw it into place. Test the faucet afterward. If it doesn\u2019t seem to be working the way you want, check all of the parts to ensure they are undamaged and have been put back correctly.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":626}

This won't affect the maximum speed of your connection, but it would cause some latency. pjc50 points out that it's about a nanosecond for every foot of cable length, which is a good rule of thumb used by many engineers when developing systems which are very dependent on latencies on those timescales.\n\nIn reality, you will never notice a difference.

In fact, nearly every step of the way involves delays which are more extreme than those seen from signal propagation. For example, most consumer grade routers will wait for the last byte of an incoming packet to be received and check it for errors before sending the first byte of the packet on its way. This delay will be on the order of 5,000&nbsp;ns!

{"conversations":["How to increase driving visibility in rain?","Driving in the rain, especially after dark, can cause dramatic declines in visibility.  The best ways to improve driving visibility in the rain are to turn on your headlights and your windshield wipers.  Stay away from large vehicles that leave a large spray in their wake.  Keep your headlights clean and clear, and change windshield wipers that are aged or deteriorating.\n\n## Use and maintain your wipers\n\n1. Turn your windshield wipers on. Unless your car comes with automatic wipers, you\u2019ll need to manually activate your windshield wipers to improve driving visibility in the rain. Windshield wipers typically have three different settings: slow, medium, and fast. If the rain is light, select the slow speed. If the rain is heavier (and your visibility is poorer), select a faster speed. If you wish, you could use the high speed in low levels of rain, but it is not necessary. There is no objective criteria for determining whether you need a faster or slower wiper speed when driving in the rain. Using your best judgment, select the wiper speed that most closely corresponds to the rain\u2019s intensity at any given time. If you have a rear windshield wiper, activate it, too.\n2. Change old or brittle wiper inserts. The windshield wiper consists of two parts: the rubber wiper insert that swipes across the windshield and the metal blade that actually holds it. Check your wiper inserts regularly for stiffness or cracks, and replace them if you detect any. Most windshield wiper inserts will need to be changed at least once every three years to improve visibility in rain. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or an auto parts store for information regarding the type and size of wiper blades you need. Generally, wiper inserts can simply be slid into and out of the metal blade itself. If you regularly park your car outside, you\u2019ll probably have to replace your windshield wipers more often than if you park in the garage.\n3. Replace windshield wiper blades as needed. If your wiper blades are rusty, bent, or corroded, replace them, too. Use high-quality wiper blades, preferably ones coated with a rain repellent. If there are areas of your windshield that do not get properly wiped when you use your wipers, you\u2019ll know that the wiper is bent or applying uneven pressure to the windshield. Generally, wiper blades can simply be unsnapped from the metal arm that holds the blade, then a new blade can be snapped in. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or your local auto parts store for information regarding the sort of wiper blades you need.\n4. Keep your wiper blades clean. Dirty windshield wiper blades can cause streaking and water beading. To clean your wiper blades, soak a lint-free cloth or paper towel in windshield washer fluid. Wipe the cloth or paper towel along the length of the blades. Turn the cloth or paper towel over as needed to ensure you\u2019re always wiping the blades with a clean area.\n\n\n## Use and clean your headlights\n\n1. Turn on your headlights. If you\u2019re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you\u2019re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights on is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you. Many headlights have different settings. Choose the correct one for the existing conditions. For instance, if you\u2019re driving in light rain through a dark area, you might choose to use your brightest headlight setting. If you\u2019re driving through fog as well as rain, use your fog lights.\n2. Wash your headlights. If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car. There is no regular schedule according to which you must wash your headlights. If your headlights appear less luminous than they previously were, or if they\u2019re visibly dirty, give them a wash.\n3. Scrub your headlights with sandpaper. For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet\/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter\u2019s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work. Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet\/dry sandpaper. Alternate the direction of your scrubbing each time. For instance, if you moved side-to-side with one piece of sandpaper, use an up-and-down scrubbing method for the next. When the discoloration, dirt, and scratches on the headlight are gone, move on to the next level of sandpaper. There is no regular schedule according to which you must engage in deep cleaning of your headlights. Give your headlights a deep cleaning with sandpaper if washing your headlights using the standard method produces inadequate results.\n\n\n## Take additional measure\n\n1. Don\u2019t follow trucks or buses closely. The spray produced by these large vehicles will decrease your visibility in rain. Try to keep several car lengths away from trucks and buses. If you need to pass trucks or buses, do so quickly so as to minimize the time you spend behind or beside them, where you can experience significant spray.\n2. Put on some polarized glasses. If you\u2019re driving through rain during the day, put on a pair of polarized sunglasses to increase your driving visibility. If you\u2019re driving in rain at night, you will not be able to increase driving visibility by wearing polarized sunglasses.\n3. Turn on the demisters if necessary. If the temperature of the rain and the temperature inside your vehicle are too different, your windows might fog over. To combat this and increase visibility when driving in the rain, turn on the demisters.\n4. Slow down. Slowing your speed can give you extra time to see what\u2019s ahead. You should be able to see the space you\u2019ll be driving through at least 12 seconds before you pass through it. When driving in the rain, adjust your speed to meet this visibility standard.\n5. Clean your windshield. Sometimes your windshield wipers are not strong enough to wipe away all the grime on your windshield. Dirt stuck to the top corners, especially, could dribble down during a rainstorm. The best way to get your windshield clean is to have it cleaned by a professional at your local auto wash. Alternately, you could soak a cloth or sponge in soapy water and wipe it across the windshield until the entire surface is clean. Clean your windshield when it is dirty. Don\u2019t forget to clean your windshield wiper blades, too.\n6. Apply a coat of rain repellent to your windshield. Rain repellents will prevent rain from beading on your windshield. Instead, rain will roll smoothly off the windshield upon contact. Specific directions for use vary depending on the product you use. Generally, though, you can simply spray the repellent of your choice on the windshield, then wipe it away using a gentle circular motion. Rain repellent solutions usually need to be applied once every six months.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":742}
{"conversations":["How to set up an aquarium?","Setting up an aquarium can be quite difficult that involves a lot of patience, maintenance, and testing before you can even add any tank inhabitants. Despite this, setting up your aquarium correctly is vital for your pets' health and longevity. There are different ways to set up different types of aquariums.\n\n## Choose an aquarium type\n\n1. Decide if you want a freshwater aquarium or saltwater aquarium. There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:\n2. Think about the size of tank you\u2019d like. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:\n3. Choose what type of saltwater aquarium you\u2019d like to set up. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank. Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums. Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock. Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists.\n4. Determine what the correct lighting and heating for your fish is. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank. Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts. Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you\u2019ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank. Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights.\n5. Choose the appropriate type of filter or filters for your tank. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:\n\n\n## Set up a freshwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical freshwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, gravel, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and soak your aquarium gravel or sand in a bucket. Use a pasta strainer to separate the dirtied water from the gravel. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, filling the tank with gravel, arranging your decorations and airstones, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are using an undergravel filter, place the bottom plates into your tank and attach all necessary tubes, airline, gang valves, and air pumps before adding your gravel. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add water to your freshwater aquarium. It\u2019s vital you treat your water with conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can find water conditioners at your local pet store with instructions on how much to add depending on how big of a tank you have. Don\u2019t fill the tank with water until you are sure of your aquarium\u2019s layout. It can get quite messy if you stick your hand in a full tank to move things around. Place a plate over your gravel to avoid messing up your tank layout. Pour water directly onto the plate so the pressure of a stream of water won\u2019t make a hole in your gravel or move your decorations around. Remove the place once your tank is full.\n5. Turn on your aquarium\u2019s filter, lights, and heater. This will begin your tank\u2019s nitrogen cycle. Ensure your tank is safe electrically before turning or plugging everything in. A power cord in the wrong place can cause serious injury to you.\n6. Wait a few days before adding fish to your tank. The nitrogen cycle takes a few days for it to completely stabilize. You might notice your tank becoming cloudy which means the cycle is kicking in. You can add some hardy fish like feeder goldfish to your tank to speed up the nitrogen cycle. However, don\u2019t expect the fish to survive, as the harsh conditions of a new aquarium can be quite stressful and inhospitable. Use a nitrate testing kit to ensure your aquarium is at its best quality before adding your fish.\n\n\n## Set up a saltwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical saltwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water. Your substrate will be cleaned after your aquarium is set up.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, arranging your power heads, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are adding a live rock, do not add substrate or decorations to your tank. You must cure your live rock before you can do this. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add saltwater to your aquarium. The saltwater mix you purchased should have detailed instructions on how to prepare your saltwater. Generally, you will be mixing room temperature water with the salt mix in a bucket or several buckets. If you don\u2019t have enough buckets, you will need to prepare your water in parts or mix the salt right in the tank. Check your salt levels with your refractometer. Typically, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.021 and 1.024 depending on the temperature of your water. Measuring the specific gravity of your saltwater means measuring the density of your water since adding salt to water increases the density of water.\n5. Cure your live rock. If you have FOWLR tank, you will need to start the process of curing your live rock, which could take up to 2 months to complete. To begin the process:\n6. Prepare your substrate before adding it to your tank. Before adding any substrate to your tank, you will need to prepare a bucket of saltwater to help clean it. Add your substrate into the bucket and stir. This allows the dust and dirt from your substrate to rise for you to siphon out with your aquarium vacuum. Use a cup or ladle to add your clean substrate to the tank. You will need to drain more water out of your aquarium to accommodate the addition of your substrate and any decorations.\n7. Wait a few days before adding fish to your aquarium. Thoroughly check your aquarium\u2019s water salinity, pH, ammonia, nitrate, and hardness levels using your test kits before adding any fish. The ideal readings for a saltwater aquarium with a live rock are:\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":723}

{"conversations":["How to identify ticks?","While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":788}

Although it can sometimes seem like a daunting undertaking, there are plenty of reasons to do so.\n\n*  It enhances your brain.  The complex process by which we learn a language can increase white and grey matter volume in the brain. Some of these regions of the brain are associated with things like enhanced problem-solving, focusing, and switching between tasks.  \n\n*  It boosts your career prospects. Several surveys have shown that those who can speak more than one language have the potential to earn more money. It also means that more opportunities are available to you. Whether you want to work in a different country or in a role that requires you to be multilingual, being proficient in a second language can help significantly.  \n\n*  It improves other skills. As you work on your language skills, you\u2019ll also learn and be able to demonstrate a variety of other competencies. Learning a foreign language helps with things like creativity, multitasking, and problem-solving skills. \n\n*  It helps you meet new people. Whichever language(s) you choose to learn, you\u2019re giving yourself the opportunity to meet and interact with new people. Whether it\u2019s through a language course, learning app, or on your travels, you\u2019ll be able to communicate with people who don\u2019t necessarily share your native tongue. \n\n*  It helps cultural understanding. One of the essential elements of learning a language is understanding the different cultures that speak it. This cultural insight gives you the chance to travel to new locations (after the pandemic), immerse yourself in the lifestyle, and even improve your intercultural understanding in the workplace.

Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":348}

You don't want to put the fuel in until the last minute, to save it (Most rocket fuel is cryogenic). When the rocket has its fuel loaded, you want to keep non-essential personnel away from it, making it so any tasks they need to do is put off until the end. You don't want to arm the system to launch until you are completely ready, thus, it only happens right before.

This is voluntary, and she can refuse. If she refuses, they will give her a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings in immigration court at a later date. There, she will be able to present her case to the immigration judge, and if the immigration judge determines that she has not abandoned residence, the immigration judge can grant the waiver for her failure to meet the documentary requirements (think of it as a second opinion on the immigration officer's decision).\n\nThe other option to all this is that she can apply for an SB1 returning resident visa at a US consulate (which will meet the documentary requirements since it is an immigrant visa).

{"conversations":["What command do I use to find the size of all the files (recursively) in a Linux or Mac OS X directory?","The BSD version of ```du``` used in OS X reports size with 512-byte blocks -- the sizes are essentially rounded up to the next 512-byte value.

Practice Beolcho \"\ubc8c\ucd08\" and Seongmyo \"\uc131\ubb18\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"\uc1a1\ud3b8\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":722}

{"conversations":["How to save gift wrapping paper?","We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":652}
{"conversations":["Since long time ago I have been thinking in two problems that I have not been able to solve. It seems that one of them was recently solved. I have been thinking a lot about the motivation and its consequences. Mostly because people used to motivate one of them with some very interesting implications. My conclusion however, is that there is a mistake in the motivation of the problem, and that, while being a really interesting result, it does not make any sense in the setting in which is formulated. As my opinion is not relevant compared to one of the experts in the area, I do not say anything. \nMy question is if you can provide me some examples of conjectures that were believed to be interesting in the mathematical community because of a specific reason, but that once having the proof, people realized that the reason to motivate the problem  was not truly related to its solution. Or in other words, the solution of the problem gives no clues about the original motivation. ","The three-body problem is one of the most famous problems in the history of mathematics, which also has an important application in science: it was supposed to explain the Moon's motion, among other things. Enormous effort was spent on this problem by many famous mathematicians of the 18th and 19th centuries. Since Newton's time it was clear that there was no simple closed form solution. (The problem also had an important practical application in 18th century, namely to navigation. If you can predict the motion of the Moon for few years ahead with sufficient accuracy, you can determine longitude at sea without a chronometer, just by observing Moon's position with respect to the stars).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, an exact mathematical formulation of what was desired was achieved: to express the motions of the bodies in the form of convergent series of functions of time, valid for all times. Few people remember nowadays that in this precise form the problem was actually solved (by Sundman, at the very end of the 19th century). This solution can be found in Siegel's book on celestial mechanics.\n\nBut by that time it was already understood that this solution was useless for practical purposes, namely for prediction of the Moon's motion over long time periods. It was also useless for understanding the qualitative features of the motion."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":83}

{"conversations":["How to write metal song lyrics?","## Step\n\n1. Understand the meaning behind Metal Music. Metal is considered a \"counter-culture,\" meaning it opposes \"the normal, functional, and unexciting Culture that was dominant in society [and] by being outside of that which was in power, Counter-culturalists argued, they were able to see what was real.\" So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.\n2. Pick a topic. Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the \"popular\" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners' political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and\/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier. Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.\n3. Brainstorm the topic. Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real \"truths\" rather than perceived \"morals\" or popular \"beliefs\" on the subject. Start with what is \"society's perspective.\" Think of what the culture promotes as the correct \"belief\" or \"moral\" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such \"war for peace,\" \"religiously-motivated murder,\" or \"victim-blaming.\" Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view? Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect? Find a \"truth\" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.\n4. Start to weave together the basic parts of the song. Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as \"verse-chorus-verse-chorus.\" Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:\n\t* \n\t* What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main \"truth\"? What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute \"morals\" that they had? What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?\n5. Develop and formulate the lyrical poem. Don't stick to \"rhyming patterns\" or \"rules behind poetry.\" Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your \"story\" to the listener.\n6. Consider finding a literary device(s) to add depth to the song. Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:\n\t* What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.) What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.) Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)\n7. Develop the sound to go with the lyrics. Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.\n8. Come back to the song, and revise as necessary. Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying\/hearing.\n\n\n## Example: black sabbath's \"war pigs\"\n\n1. Black Sabbath set out to create Metal's counter-culture. Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.\n2. They choose the topic of war. This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic \"American\" beliefs behind the war effort. Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace. Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves. Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death. The \"truth\": Politicians have the power and misuse it.\n3. Black Sabbath then started to weave together these basic ideas into the song, \"War Pigs\". They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution. Rising Action: \"Generals gathered in their masses,\" \"In the fields the bodies burning,\" and \"Evil minds that plot destruction\" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from. Climax: \"Politicians hide themselves away\" and \"Wait 'til their judgement day comes\" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did. Resolution: \"Now in darkness world stops turning,\" and \"No more war pigs have the power\" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.\n4. Black Sabbath began to formulate these basic parts of the song together. Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a \"story.\" They tied the rising action to the climax with the \"oh lord yeah\" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.\n5. Literary devices were used to add depth to the song. Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of \"war pigs.\" Popular images of \"tanks,\" \"machines,\" and \"battle fields\" are all references in the song. Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted. Fictitious and mythological images of \"sorcerers\" and \"witches\" are used in the song.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":780}
{"conversations":["How to make rose centerpieces?","Roses are a great addition to any table for any occasion. Instead of placing them into a vase, however, why not get more creative? Rose centerpieces are easy to make, and you can use silk roses or real ones. Topiaries are the most popular, but you can also create a simpler one by placing a rose into a tall vase and filling it to the top with water.\n\n## Make a silk rise topiary\n\n1. Hot glue a Styrofoam ball to the top of a glass or crystal candlestick. Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal. Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.\n2. Get a bouquet of mini silk roses and snip the flowers off. Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose. If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.\n3. Poke a rose into the top of a Styrofoam ball. If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in. You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball. You can use tacky glue or hot glue.\n4. Add more roses in a ring around the first one. Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.\n5. Continue adding roses in rings until you reach the bottom of the Styrofoam ball. When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.\n6. Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the candlestick. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.\n\n\n## Make a real rise topiary\n\n1. Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam. There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop. Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.\n2. Put the foam block into a vessel. You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase. If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape. If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape.\n3. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect. Plan on using about 48 roses. If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier. Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch.\n4. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle. It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well. If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).\n5. Poke the roses into the foam. Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch. Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam. If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest. You can arrange it in stripes or rings.\n6. Add some finishing touches. At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:\n\t* Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece. Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.\n\n\n## Make an underwater vase\n\n1. Get a tall, glass, cylindrical vase. You can also use a square vase instead. You will be placing the entire rose inside the vase and then filling the vase all the way with water. Try to get a vase that is at least 12 inches (30.48-centimeters) tall. This will make your centerpiece look more elegant. Consider wrapping a crystal trim around the base of the vase. You can find it in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.\n2. Trim a rose down until it is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) shorter than the vase. You will need the extra space inside the vase for the floating candle. If the rose is too tall, it will stick out of the water\/vase and ruin the effect. You can trim off the leaves or leave them on. Cut real roses with clean garden shears. Cut silk roses with wire cutters. If you chose to leave the leaves on a real rose, rinse them off under cool water. This will get rid of any dust that might muddy up the water.\n3. Insert the rose into a frog pin. A frog pin is a coin-sized metal disk with pins sticking out of it, like a hairbrush. You can find them in the floral section of an arts and crafts store. Try to wedge the rose's stem between the pins rather than straight into them. Consider adding a few more shorter roses into the pin. A frog pin is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the rose secure. If you cannot find a frog pin, you will have to add more vase filler later on.\n4. Place the rose into the bottom of the vase. For an added effect, consider turning on a submersible LED light, and adding it into the bottom of the vase as well. Make sure that the LED light is meant for being used in underwater floral arrangements. You can find them in the floral department of an arts and crafts shop.\n5. Fill the bottom of the vase filler. Scoop the filler out of the bag with your hands, then carefully spread it across the bottom of the vase. This will prevent the filler from damaging the rose's petals. Keep filling the vase until the frog pin is covered. You can use tiny acrylic pellets or crystals, of glass gems or marbles. If you weren't able to find a frog pin, fill the bottom of the vase with 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of vase filler, or until the rose stands up on its own.\n6. Fill the vase with cool water. Stop when you are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the rim of the vase. The entire rose, including the bloom, should be submerged under water.\n7. Place a floating candle on top. Make sure that the bottom of the candle does not bump up against the rose. If it does, add more water or trim the rose down. You can use a regular round candle or a rose-shaped one.\n8. Place the vase on your table. Consider scattering acrylic gems or metallic confetti around the vase. You can also make a few more vases that are taller or shorter than the one you just made.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":607}
{"conversations":["What are some strategies to maintain morale and productivity after massive layoffs? I am not in a managerial role, just a lead role, and am asking for myself and my fellow employees.","The situation you're describing is tough. Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":55}

He is copying the behavior of others, whether it's a good act or bad...\nPlease help me how to stop him from being a bully.","Welcome to the \"Terrible Two's\"! \n\nYour son behaves typically for his age. At 2 he starts to assert himself and express his demands. It's likely that he has also learned that he gets his way when he throws a tantrum. For a 2-year old screaming, hitting or even biting is a normal way to express his anger - at least he will try and every success reinforces this.\nHe also comes across more limitations: The more he is able to do, the more often he is stopped.\n\nThe solution? It's already in your question:\nHe will copy what others do. So by all means, stay calm. No yelling, no fussing and - please! - no hitting. He has some learning (accepted behaviour like sharing) and some unlearning (no hitting or pushing) to do and needs your help. \n\n* When he throws a tantrum, either ignore him, or quietly remove him from the scene. Do not worry about others! Most likely they have had the same trouble with their kids or will some time ;-) \n* When he doesn't want to share yet - fine, he will learn. This can be practiced. Don't make him share, or he will resent it. Rather, teach him the benefits of sharing. Start with food, for example. Have a plate of cookies (or other favorite food), that's yours. He will likely demand some, but demanding doesn't get him a cookie. Asking nicely will! Explain, repeat. Then, switch roles. If he has cookies, ask him to share. If he does, praise him. Else - remind him next time when he wants your cookies that he didn't share. Share whenever possible: Having a bite from your plate, getting a piece off his. Repeat, repeat, repeat.... Same goes for objects. Ask him to \"please\" share a toy, \"play\" with it for a short moment, then return. Say \"Thank you\". He learns, that he gets the toy back. Share some of your things. (Monitor the behaviour of other children, that want his toys - make sure they ask first and give toys back, at least during this learning stage.)\n\nYou have some serious work to do, but it will be sooooo worth it!

{"conversations":["How to walk a slackline?","## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand\/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":740}

First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President\u2019s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.

{"conversations":["Traditional advice for making megadungeons in older versions of D&D is in addition to any rooms with Monsters, Treasure, Traps, or \"Tricks\", there should also be at least 50 to 60 percent \"Empty\" rooms, which contain nothing overtly threatening or valuable.  Now, there's several arguments for including these empty rooms that I buy, so I'm not going to accept any answer which primarily says, \"Don't include empty rooms\".  The main issue I run into with empty rooms, however, is that they're boring in the way that I've been including them.  They don't do their job of increasing tension, and the set dressing included around them hasn't been sufficiently interesting to my players either.  My question is this: How can I make empty rooms interesting, by increasing tension or simply being interesting in and of themselves?","By definition, nothing's going to happen in an empty room (though see below). There are no hidden doors to find, no puzzles to solve, no enemies to fight. So what's their purpose?\n\n## Bringing the dungeon to life\nWhile all the orcs may sit around in a guard room waiting for PCs to show up, where do they sleep, what do they eat, what happens to their trash? Think of a dungeon not just as a place to have fights in, but as an actual place that serves a purpose. Once you do, the dungeon will start making sense. &quot;Empty&quot; rooms will increase immersion for the players, and force you to consider things you may not have otherwise. Should there be a pet otyugh that eats the trash? Are the orcs demanding cows from the local farmers for &quot;protection&quot;? Do they keep a famed halfling cook enslaved, to make them rare steaks?\n\n## Foreshadowing\nOnce the dungeon makes sense, you can use that to place clues for things that dwell deeper within. Has a horde of zombies marched through to guard the necromancer's abode within, and left a few rotten body parts here and there? Has a malevolent force been summoned and spoiled all the meat and milk in the dungeon? Is there a golem maintenance station, with oil to grease them, rags to polish them, and a mad goblin mechanic? These may be vital clues PCs need to prepare for a tough fight, or they can simply let them form theories and feel smart about being right once they do come upon a golem or three.\n\n#Currently empty\nThese rooms are empty now, but they don't have to stay that way.

Read their review, filter their non-technical rants, keep whatever helpful criticism you can extract from their comments, and address them nicely and respectfully. It may actually be that the techniques you used were adequate but you failed to point out why and how it would be unnecessary to use more expensive methods. Always assume that they are right. If they are mistaken, respectfully point out in your response why you are right and edit the original manuscript to make the issue clearer to future readers.\n\nFor instance, if the reviewer wrote:\n\n> The methods used in the paper are abysmal. The authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale. The atomic mass interferometer, which uses gravitational waves and is able to precisely infer mass with an uncertainty of one atomic mass unit per kilogram, is the state of the art in weighting.\n\nYou can write as a response:\n\n* The reviewer is absolutely correct that atomic mass interferometry (AMI) is the state of the art in weighting. However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance).","Do reviewers that make those kinds of comments tend to accept papers after these kinds of revisions?","Reviewers don't accept papers, editors do. If you carefully address each of the reviewers' comments in a respectful and thorough manner, clearly explaining your choices and providing additional evidence or clarification where necessary, there is a chance that the revised paper will be accepted for publication.

{"conversations":["Why doesn't the nuclear fusion in a star make it explode?","The fusion that occurs in the core of the Sun occurs in nothing like the conditions you might be thinking of in a bomb, or a fusion reactor. In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250\u00a0W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250\u00a0W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion. This is exactly what happens in the core as more hydrogen is turned into helium; the core temperature and luminosity do rise, but slowly, on timescales of billions of years."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":333}

See Step 1 to begin learning how to open 99% of all standard school lockers.\n\n## Open when you know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Spin the dial at least three times to the right (clockwise), all the way around. This \"clears\" the lock of any previous numbers. If at any point in putting in your combination you mess up, do this again to start over.\n2. Enter your combination. Turn the dial to the right and stop at your first number. Always start with a turn to the right! For your second number, turn the dial to the left, going past zero and your first number. Then stop at your second number. Some locks are a bit odd or finicky -- if your locker isn't opening after you put the three numbers in correctly, try turning left past your second number once and stopping on it on the next go around. For your third number, turn the dial to the right and go directly to the last number. Leave your lock on this number. Always remember: right, left, right.\n3. Open the lock. Pull the lock open and out of the hole, or pull the latch or handle, if there is one. Otherwise, tug on the knob to open the locker. If your locker just won't open, try it again with the last number being five before or after your \"official\" last number. Sometimes the older locks get, the shakier they get in their requirements or abilities. If that doesn't work, ask your classmates or teacher if there are any similar quirks in the school locker system. Try twice before you call a teacher.\n4. Lock your locker after use. Make sure, if you have a locker with an unattached lock, that you lock your locker when you leave. If you don't, it's possible your things will get stolen or your lock will be turned backwards. Close your lock up and twist the dial a bit. If you leave it on the final number, it may open up again effortlessly, for someone other than you.\n\n\n## Open when you don't know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Apply pressure upward. This means taking your finger and wrapping it around the latch. It should pull up just a teeny bit when it's locked. While you're doing this, rotate the lock counterclockwise until it locks. You may have to apply a bit of strength to do this, but it won't break it.\n2. Write down the numbers it locks at. Repeat this action 11 more times. Seven of the numbers you get will be between two digits; ignore those. Continue with the 5 outliers. Of those 5, 1 should not end in the same digit. That's your third number. Obviously, it's very important to know exactly where the lock stops at. Be diligent and take a keen eye to your lock.\n3. Use trial and error. You're now down to just 100 possible combinations -- that's 15 minutes' work. Your third number actually allows you to eliminate possible first and second numbers, believe it or not.

She's outside somewhere, outside where it's spring. I want to see her again. I want to know she's safe.\nThe pain comes suddenly and sharply to my face, my head, then my stomach. The light is bright and blurry. My ears ring over the voices of the men yelling at me. I'm told to standup and to lay down at the same time. I'm kicked when I don't. A guard grabs me and stands me up, I see that he's yelling something at me.\nIt's dark, my hands are tied, I feel a gag in my mouth. I get the strong smell of musk and vomit in the mask. I hear a truck rumble under my body as we drive over gravel and dirt roads. Hours passed by.\n\"Are you ready for your test?\" My guards joked. They stopped the truck.\nI remain silent. They dragged me off the truck. They tie me to a chair.\nIn the darkness I hear a man say, \"Your test is ready. Are you ready?\" I wonder what they mean.\n\"Yes.\" I hear a little girl squeak. I know that voice I thought.\nThey un-hood me... I see her... standing there with hate in her eyes. They give her a gun. I yell out to her, but I'm still gagged.\n\"Good!\" the man says. \"Now shoot him.\"\nSomewhere outside it's spring and birds freshly hatched from their eggs chirp out for food and love."],"source":"writingprompts","idx":939}

{"conversations":["In Harry Potter And The Order of The Phoenix, Voldemort attempts to kill Harry in the Ministry after Sirius's death. Dumbledore arrives just in time to save Harry, shielding him with the wizard's statue. \nWhy did he defend Harry there? He knew of him being a Horcrux after the attack on Arthur Weasley (on examining one of his instruments), and presumably knew he had to die at Riddle's hands.\nWhy did he postpone the inevitable? ","It's hard to give a definitive reason for a fictional character's motivations when they aren't explicitly described anywhere, but there are any number of reasons events may have unfolded as they did.\n\n1. Dumbledore wasn't Voldemort-- he wasn't cool with murdering innocent people or allowing innocent people to die through inaction (certainly not in this phase of his life). He also showed a strong commitment to his students' safety and wellbeing, even in the case of a student that he knew for a fact was actively trying to murder him. Killing someone because it would be convenient or helpful is not a Professor Dumbledore move.\n\n2. It's not clear how much information Dumbledore had on the Horcruxes at that point. It's easy for a reader to look back at the novels and determine that Harry was 100% fated to die at some point in the struggle against Voldemort, but that's not a great guide an in-universe character's knowledge and motivations.\n\n3. Dumbledore was actively resisting Voldemort in every way he could manage at the time, and in particular wanted Voldemort's return to become public knowledge. It's not impossible that he viewed Voldemort's attack as an opportunity to injure, weaken, or otherwise frustrate Voldemort's efforts. At a minimum his approach was enough to force Ministry officials to accept that Voldemort was back, but it's also reasonable to think that if Voldemort clearly wanted something to happen, Dumbledore didn't want it to happen.\n\n4. Voldemort was clever and dangerous, and one of the few things Dumbledore could be pretty sure he would do was hunt Harry. With Harry dead, Voldemort would become less predictable but no less dangerous.\n\n5. Destroying all of the Horcruxes was important to defeating Voldemort but destroying any one was not-- that was the very reason Voldemort created so many of them. His being one seventh less immortal isn't an obviously huge setback for him, and indeed he did not seem to even notice that some of the Horcruxes were destroyed.\n\n6. The difficulty around the Horcruxes was mostly in finding and gaining possession of them, because Voldemort had hidden them away and protected them. Harry himself, on the other hand, was generally pretty easy to find over the course of the novels. Even if Dumbledore felt that Harry would need to die, there wasn't any reason that this particular opportunity for him to do so was unique or rare.","I think there is one additional point: 7. Harry's willing sacrifice was an important part of his surviving the horcrux extraction. If he had died in book five (especially right after Siruis died) he would have almost certainly have stayed dead.\n","The sacrifice probaly doesn't work for himself. It enabled him to protect everyone else he cared about from Voldemort but it doesnt protect themselves otherwise why did Lily die? If he had died at the Ministry he most likely could have chosen to come back as he did in the forest but becuase he didnt sacrifice himself willingly there no one else would have protection from Voldemort. The thing that protected himself from Voldemorts spells at the end was the fact he was the owner of the Elder Wand.","Is it mentioned somewhere that it was Elder Wand that saved him? I'd expect that Voldermort could cast Killing Curse wandless and asleep. How would weaker wand prevent him from successfully casting it? Could wand itself alter the curse (not weaken, alter specifically to target the horcrux)?","This comes straight from the book:\n> Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the **Elder Wand** fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the **master it would not kill**, who had come to take full possession of it at last."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1019}

{"conversations":["How to wear long coats?","A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you\u2019re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you\u2019d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you\u2019d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men\u2019s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you\u2019re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn\u2019t too small. It\u2019s easy to buy a long coat that\u2019s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you\u2019re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you\u2019re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you\u2019re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren\u2019t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well. Try a pale blue, pink, or white long coat with light blue cropped jeans or shorts. Add a colorful fitted T-shirt and sandals to complete the look. Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that\u2019s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels. Wear a black blouse with this outfit, and try to match your heels with the coat for the best effect. For example, a camel coat with this outfit looks elegant with a pair of shiny nude heels.\n2. Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur \u2013 there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats. Choose a black or white faux-fur coat and pair it with strappy heels, a short or mid-length skirt, or capris pants for an elegant look. Either chunky or stiletto heels work for this look; just make sure they are high and strappy.\n3. Pair leather leggings and heels with an extra-long black coat for serious glam. Find yourself a pair of black faux leather leggings and combine them with black heels of your choice for a glamourous look. Wear a simple white blouse underneath to finish off this look. Add a pair of classic large black sunglasses to this look for some extra glam.\n4. Wear a long unbuttoned coat over a cocktail dress for a night out. Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards\u2019 coat for versatility. The Paletot and Guards\u2019 coat styles are classic business coats for men that can be worn for any formal occasion. They are double-breasted with 2 rows of 6 buttons and peaked lapels. Navy blue or charcoal colors of this coat can be worn to a business meeting, over a tuxedo, or to a funeral.\n6. Pair a fitted long coat with dress trousers and loafers for any formal occasion. Dress trousers and shiny loafers, paired with a tucked button-down shirt, look sharp under any fitted long coat. Match your trousers to the coat and choose a dark colored shirt in the winter, or a lighter colored shirt in the summer. Add a tie that compliments your shirt to make this look extra formal.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":665}

Light flowing fabrics make beautiful wedding gowns but may require a little extra support underneath to avoid showing unwanted bulges or panty lines. Find shapewear that hides any problem areas, and a slip made from similar fabric as your gown in case your gown slips. To reduce the layers you need to wear, try a shaping slip in the same color as your dress.\n2. Choose high-waisted shaping lingerie for a mermaid dress. Mermaid dresses show off all your natural curves by hugging your body, so consider lingerie that draws in your waist and doesn\u2019t show panty lines. A high-waisted thong is a good option, on its own or coupled with a bustier.\n3. Find a bustier or corset for your ballgown. Many ballgown style dresses already have a structured corset or bustier in them, but if yours doesn\u2019t, find one that matches the color of your dress. Choose a bustier bra that\u2019s seamless and strapless to support and lift your bust while slimming your torso. Panties for your ballgown can be any style you choose, since a ballgown is loose in the skirt area and you won\u2019t be able to see panty lines.\n4. Choose any lingerie for A-line dresses. A-line, or princess-style dresses, are fitted at the top and flow out below the bustline. If this is the type of dress you have, you can choose any lingerie based on your comfort or preference instead of shaping or support. Keep in mind the shape of the top of your dress when choosing a bra; if the dress has a deep neckline or is strapless, you\u2019ll want to find a strapless bra or skip a bra altogether.\n5. Find a backless bra with adhesive sides for a backless dress. If you have a halter or other type of backless dress, you may want support or coverage from your lingerie. Choose an adhesive bra that matches the color of your dress to get the support you need. Adhesive bras also work great for strapless dresses if you can\u2019t find a strapless bra that you like.\n6. Match the lingerie color to your dress. Try bringing a swatch of the fabric that your gown is made from with you when you shop for lingerie. Some bridal gown retailers offer a swatch so you can match accessories with your gown. If you don\u2019t have a sample of the fabric, try ordering more than one shade of lingerie and keep the one that best matches your gown. Matching your lingerie with your dress instead of your skin tone is helpful in case your gown slips a bit. Your lingerie won\u2019t be as obvious if the shade matches your dress.\n\n\n## Choose wed night lingerie\n\n1. Wear whatever you\u2019ll feel sexy in. There are certain myths surrounding wedding night lingerie that it has to look a certain way, but only you and your fianc\u00e9 know what you like. This means if you don\u2019t want to wear white, don\u2019t! You can wear anything from boyfriend-style pajamas to French maid costumes, so don\u2019t be afraid to choose something unique to you.\n2. Choose flowery white lace for the classic feminine look. If you want to go a traditional route, find a comfortable white or cream bra and panty set made from sheer flowery lace. Or go with a short white lacy gown. Some lingerie combines lace and faux-fur for an extra feminine touch.\n3. Try an artsy corset with suspenders, stockings, and heels for a bolder approach. If bold is more your style, think straps! Look for a detailed, beaded or embroidered corset with suspenders, fishnet or lace thigh-highs, and a pair of matching heels. Choose any color theme you like for this lingerie based on your preference. Some corsets have a connected underwear component with suspenders; others don\u2019t, in which case, you can find a matching thong to complete your outfit.\n4. Choose a lacy jumpsuit or teddie if you like one-pieces. Find a lacy halter mini-shorts jumpsuit to combine sporty and feminine looks. Or go bold and feminine with a sheer or strappy teddie in any color that you like. To stay on the more traditional side, choose white or cream for your one-piece lingerie. Or choose a pastel pink or blue for a romantic, feminine effect. Black or red also work well with these pieces if you want a bolder look.\n5. Get a sheer dressing gown for some added luxury. Regardless of what style lingerie you get, consider a sheer dressing gown to drape over it, as an extra piece to remove on your wedding night, for lounging around in the morning, or both.\n6. Consider a separate registry just for lingerie if you\u2019re having trouble deciding. If you like too many pieces to choose, let a few close friends and your fianc\u00e9 choose for you! Create a registry online with a lingerie store, add some of your favorite pieces, and give your bridesmaids and fianc\u00e9 the link before your bridal shower. This gives the people who know you best a chance to help you decide. You may end up with more than one item, but that\u2019s okay. Choose one for your wedding night and save the rest for your honeymoon!\n\n\n## Consider your body type\n\n1. Choose strappy lingerie on a muscular frame. You can probably pull off some pretty daring looks if you\u2019re in good shape. Choose lingerie with lots of straps, bold colors, or a cinched waistline to show it off.\n2. Try a plunging neckline and briefs if you\u2019re pear-shaped. Pear-shaped women are smaller up top with wider hips, butt, and thighs. Show off this type of figure with pieces that go low at the neckline and brief-style underwear. Or experiment with colors by wearing bold, bright patterns up top.\n3. Go with v-cut panties and a full coverage bra or corset if you\u2019re apple-shaped. Apple-shaped ladies carry more weight in the top half of their bodies and have slender legs. Show off this type of body by providing full bust coverage and concealing your stomach area, if you want to. Think lots of lace up top and brightly colored panties.\n4. Try a garter belt or any waist-cincher for an hourglass figure. Hourglass figures have a proportioned build with bust and thigh measurements that are about equal, and are slimmer at the waist. Show off your waistline with a flattering belt or any accessory that draws attention to it.\n5. Go wireless for a small bust. If you don\u2019t need an underwire bra on your wedding day, don\u2019t bother with one. Try a feminine lacy bralette or a racerback style bra if you have a small chest. You can likely find some cute halter one-pieces as well.\n6. Choose high-waisted bottoms for a long torso. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, you can choose from the variety of high-waisted styles that are so popular. Try a lacy crop top set with high-waisted bottoms to draw more attention to your shoulders and legs.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":698}
{"conversations":["Why do many vinyl albums of classical music have Sides 1 \/ 4 on the first record and 2 \/ 3 on the second? An example of this is the RCA Red Seal recording of Beethoven's 9th Symphony by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.","Many phonographs were able to play multiple records in sequence with a mechanism that would hold one or more records on the turntable, and one or more additional records elevated on the center post.\nAt the end of one record, the mechanism sensed the tone arm reaching close to the center of the record, and then lifted it, pulled it out beyond the edge of the records. The system then dropped the bottom record of those on the center post, leaving the rest of them. Then the tone arm mechanism moved the tone arm to the outside of the record and lowered it to the record.\nThe mechanism was pretty ingenious, but it couldn't flip records over. So, to play a long piece, it would play one side of each record until the stack was exhausted. Then it was up to a person to flip the stack to play the opposite sides in sequence.\nSo, when playing records 1A\/1B, 2A\/2B, 3A\/3B, 4A\/4B in such a mechanism, the play order would be 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, (flip), 4B, 3B, 2B, 1B. The \"B\" sides would go the other way because flipping the whole stack would put them in the opposite order.\nPurists would take offense at the idea of letting records drop like that, but it was an irresistible convenience to people who could tolerance slightly quicker wear of their records."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":132}
{"conversations":["Can brain cells move? By movement I mean long distance migration (preferably within the brain only).","The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Kl\u00e4mbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":0}

{"conversations":["How to manage urinary incontinence in children?","Urinary incontinence (UI) is a medical term that refers to the loss of bladder control, which leads to accidental urine loss. This can happen during the day or at night. Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects many children when they are young and disappears as they grow and develop. To provide better support for your child with UI, it is important to understand how UI works and possible management solutions.\n\n## Understand the bladder\n\n1. Know how the bladder works. The bladder is a bodily organ that is essentially a muscular storage sack for urine. Normally, the bladder muscle sack can stay relaxed and expand to accept urine for several hours. The muscle that forms the bladder sack is called the detrusor muscle, which is also responsible for bladder emptying. The other main muscles of the bladder are called the sphincters, which are two rings of muscle surrounding the bladder outlet through which it empties. One sphincter is involuntary (you aren't aware of it) and the other is usually under our control, making it our voluntary sphincter. The latter is the muscle you can use to hold the urine back until you go to the bathroom.\n2. Learn about bladder control. There are nerves in your body that provides you with the sensation of bladder fullness. This is the early warning system that the bladder is ready to empty. When you urinate, the nerves to the detrusor muscle signal it to contract or squeeze, while at the same time, the nerves to the involuntary sphincter make it relax. When you release your voluntary sphincter, you allow yourself to urinate. By around age two, most children become aware that the sensation that they feel \u201cdown there\u201d is the need for the bladder to empty. This allows them to express the need to go to the bathroom. About a year later, they develop the ability to \u201chold it\u201d until they have a chance to go to the bathroom.\n3. Be aware of the causes of incontinence. There are issues that can cause problems when a child is learning how to \u201chold it\u201d. While most kids develop the ability to hold their urine and go to the bathroom when they have the opportunity to do so, problems can arise that can mess up a child's ability to control her bladder. These issues that are related to childhood incontinence can include:\n\t* A bladder that is unable to store the usual amount of urine. Weakness of the detrusor muscles or sphincter. Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. The body producing larger amounts of urine than is normal. Bladder irritation from infections, such as urinary tract infections, or other bladder irritants. The bladder receiving unexpected and premature nerve signals to empty. Something in the area of the bladder keeping it from filling completely, such as other excrement caused by constipation. Excessive postponement of urination, or holding it for too long. Chronic constipation.\n4. Disregard the myths about incontinence. If your child has been dealing with incontinence for an extended period of time, chances are she is dealing with more of an issue that simply being too lazy to get to the bathroom. A lot of parents tend to think that daytime incontinence is a display of laziness, but it is important to keep in mind that something else might be causing your child to have accidents. Common thoughts that parents have that should probably be ruled out if your child has been dealing with incontinence for awhile. In these situations, you should know that:\n\t* Children who wet themselves are not just too lazy to go to the bathroom. Children who wet themselves are not too busy playing or watching TV. Children who wet themselves want to go to the bathroom and do not willfully wet themselves. Children who wet themselves do not choose to wait until the last minute. Wetting themselves does bother them.\n\n\n## Treat incontinence\n\n1. Look for signs of an overactive bladder. There are some common signs that your child has an overactive bladder. Signs that your child might have an incontinence problem related to under filling include:\n\t* Your child dashes to the bathroom, crosses her legs, and wiggles or drops to the floor, sitting hard on her heel. If asked, your child will often admit that she releases a little urine on the way to the bathroom. Many children also will admit that, sometimes, they run to the bathroom but only void a small amount of urine, even though they felt like they really needed to go.\n2. Look out for a cause for the \"sudden-urge-to-urinate\" phase. Some kids, while they are growing up, go through a phase where they suddenly, without warning, need to go to the bathroom really badly. This underdeveloped control, which presents itself as urge incontinence, often resolves with time as the child matures. However, this can also be the symptoms of a functionally small bladder or an overactive bladder. There are some medications that can actually increase a bladder's holding capacity. You should talk to a doctor about the options for dealing with a small or overactive bladder.\n3. Be aware of overfilling. There is a filling condition, called overfilling, that can also lead to incontinence. Overfilling is a less common condition that occurs when the bladder won't or can't empty and has an usually large capacity. Symptoms of an abnormally large capacity bladder include:\n\t* Voiding large volumes of urine frequently during the day. This can happen if the kidneys produce enormous volumes of urine. You should take your child to a doctor if you notice your child voiding a large amount of urine every time she goes to the bathroom, especially if there is a change in the amount from usual. Infrequent voiding, which is considered less than two or three times a day. This can be a sign of a spinal nerve problem, such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy. If your child has not been diagnosed with a spinal nerve problem, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your child's incontinence.\n4. Notice if your child is holding it for too long. Sometimes, if your child gets in the habit of holding his urine too long, it can result in over filling of the bladder. Your child's bladder can become enlarged if he is a chronic urine holder, which means he avoids going to the bathroom, even when he really, really has to pee. When this goes on for a long time, the muscles related to urinating become over trained, which means the muscles relax poorly, leading to bladder dysfunction like incontinence. This happens frequently when a child does not want to use the bathroom at school or other public places.\n5. Consider behavior modification therapy. Behavioral modification may be able to help your child with her urge incontinence. Most experts today favor behavior modification therapy over drugs as a first line treatment for daytime wetting of almost all types. Behavior modification is a method of training to relearn a skill such as bladder control. The therapy must be done strictly and consistently in order to get the desired results, such as your child being able to control her bladder. Behavior modification therapy generally works best in children who are older than five or six years of age. This is because younger children generally lack the self-discipline to stick to the therapy schedule. However, each child should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Child psychologists can provide good advice on how to go about creating a schedule.\n6. Create a schedule. If your child suffers from an overactive bladder, you need to create a schedule to help him. After your child goes to the bathroom in the morning, begin a strict timed voiding schedule. Normally, parents pick every two hours as the scheduled voiding time. Your child must go to the bathroom every two hours, even if he says he doesn't have to go at that specific time. That is actually the point, to get him to the bathroom before he has a bladder spasm. If you wait for the bladder spasm, you are reinforcing the absence of control. If your child does go and attempts to void, even a little, it reinforces his control about when and where he goes. If your child has an overfilled bladder, you should create the same schedule with an added step. Your child should wait four to five minutes after going to the bathroom and then try to go again. This is called double voiding in an attempt to reduce that lingering bladder volume. The goal is to change voiding habits and allow the bladder to carry a more normal volume of urine.\n7. Use an alarm system. In addition to a schedule, set an alarm to help your child remember to go to the bathroom. It can be hard to remember to go to the bathroom every two hours. Because of this, its important to set up an alarm system. When your child is at home or visiting family, such as staying at Grandma's house, set alarm clocks that go off every two hours. You can set these alarms on a smartphone or alarm clock. You can also get your child a watch that beeps or vibrates silently every two hours as a reminder for when she is at school. You may also consider trying a bed-wetting alarm if your child has nighttime incontinence (bed-wetting).\n8. Extend the voiding time. Once you have followed this schedule for four to six weeks, you should extend the voiding time. Normally, you should see improvement within four to six weeks. However, this does not mean you should stop the schedule. You should extend the time so that your child tries to urinate every three or four hours, rather than every two.\n\n\n## Treat urinary tract infections\n\n1. Notice urinary tract infections. You need to pay attention to your child to look for certain causes of incontinence. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common in girls who have just started school or have recently been potty trained. In addition to incontinence, UTIs can also cause frequent urination, a burning sensation when she urinates, cloudy or dark colored urine, strong smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. Some children who get frequent UTIs also have a condition called asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). These children, most frequently girls, have bacteria colonizing the bladder, meaning that they reside there, similar to having bacteria quietly living on our skin. This increase in bacteria in the urine can sometimes be the cause of frequent UTIs.\n2. Keep irritation at a minimum. Many kids, particularly girls, will develop irritation and inflammation in the area of the urethral and vaginal openings when they have a UTI. You can use certain creams to help relieve the irritation your child feels. In particular, a zinc oxide-containing skin barrier cream or ointment such as Desitin or Triple Paste can be very helpful. You can purchase these creams at your local pharmacy. Follow the directions on the bottle or box that the cream comes in.\n3. Change your child's clothing when it becomes wet. The bacteria that creates a UTI thrives in moist areas. When your child experiences incontinence and leaks a bit of urine onto her clothes, it's important that she changes into dry clothes to keep her from getting a UTI or to relieve the symptoms of her UTI. This will also keep it from coming back. You can explain this to her so that she does it herself, or you can ask her to tell you when this happens so that you can help her change.\n4. Ask your doctor about antibiotics. If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics to clear up the infection and prevent new infections. Your child's doctor will be able to tell you whether or not antibiotics are the appropriate treatment for your child to prevent infections. Your child will need antibiotics if he has an active UTI. The most common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, or prevention of infections, are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim sulfa. These are usually given once a day, at bedtime, at about \u00bc of the usual full treatment dose given to adults.\n\n\n## Treat constipation\n\n1. Be aware of constipation. Another common cause of incontinence is constipation. When large amounts of stool stays in the body rather than being expelled, it can limit how much room the bladder has to expand and causes the bladder to have unpredictable contractions, both of which cause incontinence. Constipation usually causes infrequent bowel movements for 3 days or more in a row, hard, pebbly stools, very large stools, or pain when moving the bowels.\n2. Have your doctor check your child. If you aren't sure how bad your child's constipation is, have a doctor figure out whether or not your child has a lot of stool backed up in her system. This can be done with the use of X-rays or through a physical examination. Knowing for sure that your child is constipated will help her overcome her incontinence issues.\n3. Ask your child to drink lots of fluids throughout the day. Many kids with urgency and incontinence tend not to drink much fluid, which actually makes their constipation worse. Try to have your child drink at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated. If your child doesn't like drinking plain water, you can give him fruit juices, milk (no more than 2-3 cups a day), and sports drinks.\n4. Increase your child's fiber intake. To help fight constipation, increase your child's daily fiber intake. Fiber is one of the best ways to get your child's bowels working properly. There are plenty of foods that are high in fiber. Try introducing as many foods that are high in fiber as possible into your child's diet. Foods high is fiber include:\n\t* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including raspberries, blueberries, green peas, spinach, collard greens, acorn squash, kale, and broccoli. Whole grain breads with at least three to four grams of fiber per serving. High fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran, Fiber One, Shredded Wheat, and All Bran. Beans, including black, lima, garbanzo, and pinto beans. Lentils and popcorn are also high in fiber.\n5. Give your child laxatives. Adding fiber-rich food to your child's diet may not be enough. If your child is still having problems, try child-safe laxatives. One laxative that is safe and frequently used is propylene glycol, more commonly known as MiraLax. MiraLax causes water to be transported into the bowel, thereby softening the stool and improving movement. You should check with your child's doctor for guidance before giving MiraLax or other laxatives to your child. Most kids require between \u00bd capfuls and two capfuls per day, and the dose may be adjusted as needed.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":725}
{"conversations":["It's the year 2114. You're a history student. Your assignment? To write an essay comparing the events of 2014 with what happened 100 years earlier.","As a history student in the year 2114, I have been tasked with comparing the events of the year 2014 to what happened exactly 100 years prior, in the year 1914. Although these two years were separated by a century, they share some striking similarities and differences that have shaped the course of history in very different ways.\n\nOne of the most significant events of 2014 was the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, which quickly became an international health crisis. Similarly, in 1914, the world was facing a health crisis with the outbreak of the First World War, which affected millions of people worldwide. Both crises brought about significant changes in the way governments and societies responded to public health and international relations, highlighting the importance of cooperation and solidarity in times of crisis.\n\nAnother similarity between 1914 and 2014 was the rise of new technologies that transformed the way people lived and worked. In 1914, the world was experiencing the dawn of the industrial age, with new machines and technologies making their way into factories and homes. Similarly, in 2014, the world was experiencing the rise of the digital age, with new technologies like smartphones and social media transforming the way people communicated and connected with one another.\n\nHowever, there were also many differences between 1914 and 2014. One of the most significant differences was the level of globalization and interdependence between countries in 2014. By this time, the world was much more interconnected than it was a century earlier, with goods, services, and people moving across borders more freely than ever before. In contrast, in 1914, the world was more divided, with nations operating largely independently of one another.\n\nAnother major difference between 1914 and 2014 was the political landscape of the world. In 1914, Europe was dominated by a complex web of alliances and rivalries that would ultimately lead to the outbreak of World War I. In contrast, the world of 2014 was marked by greater cooperation and diplomacy between nations, with the United Nations and other international organizations playing a key role in promoting peace and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while there were some similarities between 1914 and 2014, the world had undergone significant changes over the course of a century. The rise of new technologies, the growth of globalization, and the development of international institutions had all transformed the way people lived and interacted with one another.

{"conversations":["How to feel happy when christmas is over?","Christmas season is filled with excitement and fun. Families come together to celebrate and exchange gifts, and decorations change the landscape of cities and towns. Once the holiday is over, however, the lack of excitement can leave you feeling down. Get back into a good mood by being thankful for your good times, planning for the next holiday or picking up a new hobby.\n\n## Be thankful\n\n1. Reflect on the holiday. When you feel sad that the holiday is over, cheer yourself up by thinking about all of the good times that you had. There are bound to be a lot of great memories from the holiday, so focus on those when you feel upset. Go through photographs from the holiday. If you're from a family that takes a lot of photographs or videos of family gatherings, look through some of them if you're feeling low after the holidays. They'll be a great reminder of all of the fun you had. Talk to the people you celebrated with. It's never to early to begin reminiscing. Speak with your friends and family members that celebrated with you and talk about the good times at Christmas. They're bound to be able to cheer you up with a funny story from the holiday.\n2. Get excited about your gifts. While gifts aren't the only good thing about the holidays, they can make make you happy when you're sad about the holiday ending. Play with toys or gadgets, read books, and make use of all of the gifts you've been given. They'll be a welcome distraction.\n3. Spend your Christmas money. If you received money or gift cards, go out and treat yourself. You'll be cheered up by new purchases, and you may be able to forget that the holiday is over. Go out to eat or visit stores for a good distraction.\n4. Write thank you notes. Send messages to the people who got you gifts and thank them for a great holiday. Not only will you be doing a good deed, but you'll be recalling memories of the times that made you happy. Use the notes to talk about how much you enjoyed the holidays, and how you can't wait to spend time together next year.\n\n\n## Plan for the next holiday\n\n1. Replace decorations. Decorations are one of the best parts of Christmas, but if you leave them up, it may make you even more sad that the holiday is over. Even worse, the empty walls left behind by decorations you've stored may make you feel even more sad. Find creative ways to redecorate your house now that the holiday is over. Buy some plants. Greenery will spruce up your home, and you'll be able to care for the plants throughout the coming spring. Buy a new poster or painting. Large Christmas decorations like wreaths or wall-hangings can be replaced with a new poster or painting. Look for something colorful and exciting to accent your home. With a new piece of art where your decorations were, you may not even notice that your wreath is gone. Put up pictures from Christmas. Replace some of your Christmas decorations with photos from the holiday. You'll have a reminder of the good times to replace the actual decorations. Decorate for winter. Winter can be a beautiful time of year if you learn to appreciate it. Decorate your home for the season with a lot of white items, vases accented with twigs, snowflake decorations and evergreen sprigs.\n2. Plan for New Year's. Christmas may be over, but New Years is right around the corner. Plan a New Years party to get into the spirit of a different holiday. Invite any family and friends that visited for Christmas and you'll get to spend more time with them.\n3. Plan for next Christmas. While it may seem a little early to be get ready for another Christmas, it may be helpful to think about what your next Christmas will be like. Make some invitations, and plan what gifts you will give to others. Your plans might change throughout the course of the year, but you'll be able to make your plans into a good distraction.\n\n\n## Pick up a new hobby\n\n1. Exercise. Exercising will put you in a much better mood and help you burn off some of the extra Christmas-food calories. Go for a jog, lift weights or play a sport with some friends. If you live in a cold climate, January might be too chilly for much outdoor activity, so look into a gym membership or indoor sports leagues.\n2. Start a new hobby. If you've received any hobby-oriented Christmas gifts like paints, kitchen utensils or a new video game, put them to use. Throwing yourself into a new hobby and learning a new skill will help take your mind off of your sadness.\n3. Volunteer. Volunteering can help you keep your Christmas spirit alive as you help those in need. Look into helping out local soup kitchens, shelters or charities that distribute winter clothes. You'll be able to help others through the winter and take your mind off of the end of the Christmas season.\n4. Try to keep a positive attitude. While it may be depressing that Christmas is over, always try to keep up a good attitude. Remember that this Christmas isn't the last one you'll ever have, and focus on things that make you happy as much as possible. It may be especially hard to keep a positive attitude if you have to go back to work. However, think of your return to work as a blank slate and new beginning. Remind yourself that you can start back to work at a slow pace and catch up on your own time.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":703}
{"conversations":["Imagine you are in charge of reforming school education, what would you change?","If I were in charge of reforming school education, here are some changes I would make:\n\n*  Reduce standardized tests and eliminate the stigma associated with failing them. The focus on testing is harmful in so many ways. It encourages teaching to the test and rote learning. It leads to gaming the system by teachers and students. It leads to a narrowing of the curriculum as schools focus on the subjects that are tested. It discriminates against kids who aren't good at taking tests, especially kids with ADHD, dyslexia and other learning disabilities. There needs to be more evaluation of critical thinking and reasoning skills, and less emphasis on memorization and regurgitation. \n*  Enhance teacher training and support. I would make teacher education more rigorous, with more emphasis on pedagogy and less on content. A good teacher does not need to know all the answers, but needs to know how to find the answers, and how to inspire and guide students. In addition, I would make it compulsory for teachers to keep updating their knowledge of both their subject and of teaching methods. \n*  Increase government fundings for teacher training. I would invest heavily in teacher training and professional development and ensure that teachers are well supported, respected and fairly paid.<\\lit>\n*  Introduce a course on logical fallacies, starting with the most basic ones like appeal to authority, ad hominem, red herring, tu quoque, appeal to tradition, appeal to emotion, etc. I would also introduce a course on critical thinking, which would be more practical than the previous one. Students would learn how to formulate arguments and evaluate them, how to distinguish between good and bad arguments, etc.\n*  Ensure that students receive a balanced curriculum including the arts, humanities and sciences. Schools should be evaluated on how well they develop the whole student, including their social, emotional and physical wellbeing.<\\lit>"],"source":"authors","idx":407}
{"conversations":["Which is more widely supported: ```window.onload``` or ```document.onload```?","When do they fire?\n```window.onload```\n\n* By default, it is fired when the entire page loads, including its content (images, CSS, scripts, etc.).\n\nIn some browsers it now takes over the role of ```document.onload``` and fires when the DOM is ready as well.\n```document.onload```\n\n* It is called when the DOM is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.\n\nHow well are they supported?\n```window.onload``` appears to be the most widely supported. In fact, some of the most modern browsers have in a sense replaced ```document.onload``` with ```window.onload```.\nBrowser support issues are most likely the reason why many people are starting to use libraries such as jQuery to handle the checking for the document being ready, like so:\n```$(document).ready(function() { \/* code here *\/ });\n$(function() { \/* code here *\/ });\n```\n\nFor the purpose of history. ```window.onload``` vs ```body.onload```:\n\n  A similar question was asked on codingforums a while\n  back regarding the usage of ```window.onload``` over ```body.onload```. The\n  result seemed to be that you should use ```window.onload``` because it is\n  good to separate your structure from the action.\n"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":198}
{"conversations":["Can you help me make a boulder training plan for me to climb better?","Numerous effective training plans are available, tailored to your experience and abilities. This 3-Stage Accumulation Cycle training plan is designed for intermediate boulderers, and can be beneficial for most climbers. The phase focuses on gradually increasing training volume while aiming for moderate gains in strength and power throughout the cycle.\n\nAccumulation:\n\nWeek 1:\n2x challenging bouldering (45 min)\n1x volume-focused bouldering (60 min)\n1x hangboard strength training (30 min)\n1x hangboard repeaters (30 min)\n1x system training \u2013 limiters (60 min)\n2x power resistance sessions (45 min)\n\nWeeks 2-4:\nMaintain the same format, increasing total work each week.\n\nWeek 5:\nReduce workload as needed, likely to the volume of week 2.\n\nWeek 6:\n3x challenging bouldering (45 min)\n1x volume-focused bouldering (60 min)\n1x hangboard strength training (20 min)\n1x hangboard repeaters (30 min)\n1x system training \u2013 limiters (40 min)\n2x strength-endurance RT sessions (45 min)\n1x PE climbing session (45 min)\n\nWeeks 7,8:\nMaintain the same format, increasing total work each week.\n\nIntensity:\n\nWeek 1:\n3x challenging bouldering (45 min)\n1x hangboard strength training (30 min)\n1x system training \u2013 tension (40 min)\n2x strength resistance sessions (30 min)\n\nWeeks 2,3:\nFollow week 1 format, aiming to increase training load\/difficulty each week.\n\nPeak:\n\nWeeks 1-3:\nIntense bouldering with adequate rest as needed. Most effective with 3-4 short sessions per week.\nIn summary, the plan involves performing as many exercises as possible in the initial weeks, followed by more challenging exercises, and eventually even more difficult exercises with increased rest periods. Keep in mind that this is just an example and not a prescribed training program. Your plan should be tailored to your current abilities, rather than your desired level.\n"],"source":"authors","idx":454}
{"conversations":["What are some of the advantages of using one over the other?","ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC are two web frameworks developed by Microsoft - they are both good choices.  Neither of the web frameworks are to be replaced by the other nor are there plans to have them 'merged' into a single framework.  Continued support and development are done in parallel by Microsoft and neither will be 'going away'.\nEach of these web frameworks offers advantages\/disadvantages - some of which need to be considered when developing a web application.  A web application can be developed using either technology - it might make development for a particular application easier selecting one technology versus the other and vice versa.\nASP.NET Web Forms:\n\n* Development supports state\n\u2022   Gives the illusion that a web application is aware of what the user has been doing, similar to Windows applications.  I.e. Makes 'wizard' functionality a little bit easier to implement.  Web forms does a great job at hiding a lot of that complexity from the developer.\n* Rapid Application Development (RAD)\n\u2022   The ability to just 'jump in' and start delivering web forms.  This is disputed by some of the MVC community, but pushed by Microsoft.  In the end, it comes down to the level of expertise of the developer and what they are comfortable with.  The web forms model probably has less of a learning curve to less experienced developers.\n* Larger control toolbox\n\u2022   ASP.NET Web Forms offers a much greater and more robust toolbox (web controls) whereas MVC offers a more primitive control set relying more on rich client-side controls via jQuery (Javascript).\n* Mature\n\u2022   It's been around since 2002 and there is an abundance of information with regards to questions, problems, etc.  Offers more third-party control - need to consider your existing toolkits.\n\nASP.NET MVC:\n\n* Separation of concerns (SoC)\n\u2022   From a technical standpoint, the organization of code within MVC is very clean, organized and granular, making it easier (hopefully) for a web application to scale in terms of functionality.  Promotes great design from a development standpoint.\n* Easier integration with client side tools (rich user interface tools)\n\u2022   More than ever, web applications are increasingly becoming as rich as the applications you see on your desktops.  With MVC, it gives you the ability to integrate with such toolkits (such as jQuery) with greater ease and more seamless than in Web Forms.\n* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly \/ Stateless\n\u2022   URL's are more friendly to search engines (i.e.  mywebapplication.com\/users\/ 1 - retrieve user with an ID of 1 vs mywebapplication\/users\/getuser.aspx (id passed in session)).  Similarly, since MVC is stateless, this removes the headache of users who spawn multiple web browsers from the same window (session collisions).  Along those same lines, MVC adheres to the stateless web protocol rather than 'battling' against it.\n* Works well with developers who need high degree of control\n\u2022   Many controls in ASP.NET web forms automatically generate much of the raw HTML you see when an page is rendered.  This can cause headaches for developers.  With MVC, it lends itself better towards having complete control with what is rendered and there are no surprises.  Even more important, is that the HTML forms typically are much smaller than the Web forms which can equate to a performance boost - something to seriously consider.\n* Test Driven Development (TDD)\n\u2022   With MVC, you can more easily  create tests for the web side of things.  An additional layer of testing will provide yet another layer of defense against unexpected behavior.\n\nAuthentication, authorization, configuration, compilation and deployment are all features that are shared between the two web frameworks."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":195}

{"conversations":["How to drive economically?","Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":606}
{"conversations":["How to confuse cleverbot?","Cleverbot is an online program that uses complex coding to hold text-based conversations with human readers. Though Cleverbot is great at holding basic conversations, it isn't perfect. With a little trickery, it's not terribly hard to get Cleverbot to reveal the limits of its programming. Whether you're trying to administer the Turing Test (a test used to tell whether an artificial intelligence can \"pass\" as a human) or simply looking for some easy laughs, visit Cleverbot.com to get started!\n\n## Confuse cleverbot with specific trick\n\n1. Try typing in song lyrics. Compared to other computer programs, Cleverbot is an exceptionally skilled conversationalist. However, Cleverbot knows nothing of the joys of music. If you try typing in a few lines of your favorite song lyrics, most of the time, Cleverbot will interpret the lyrics literally or give a nonsensical response, even if the lyrics are well-known. Note, however, that for certain songs that are very well-known, Cleverbot actually can (and will) recite the song lyrics if you start typing them in. For instance, try typing in the opening lyrics to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\": \"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?\"\n2. Present Cleverbot with a logical paradox. A paradox is a statement, question, or idea that has an answer that can't be logically found. Since some of history's greatest thinkers have struggled to untangle logical paradoxes, it's a very safe bet that Cleverbot will be completely perplexed by most of them. In addition, Cleverbot doesn't even do well talking about subjects that have the potential to be paradoxical, like time travel. Try using some of the paradoxes below, or use a search engine to find your own \u2014 there are literally hundreds out there. \u201cIf this statement is true, then Santa Claus is real.\u201d\n\t* \"Since we haven't been visited by people from the future, does that mean that time travel will never be possible?\" \"What would happen if Pinocchio were to say, \"My nose will grow right now?\"\n3. Ask Cleverbot to play games with you. Cleverbot isn't terribly playful. For instance, if you ask it to join you in a game of chess or checkers, it'll say \"OK\", but then if you say, \"You go first,\" you'll get a nonsensical response. This is probably due to the fact that Cleverbot doesn't really have the capacity to play games \u2014 it knows to say that it wants to play chess with you, but it has no idea how to actually play chess. Cleverbot can, however, play rock paper scissors. Try it \u2014 say \"Let's play rock paper scissors\" and then say either \"Rock\", \"Paper\", or \"Scissors\".\n4. Type a sappy romantic dialog for Cleverbot. Sooner or later, almost everyone casually messing around with Cleverbot will get the idea to jokingly express the love or attraction they feel towards it. Though Cleverbot can handle basic overtures of love like \"I love you\" and \"Marry me\", it's not so good at interpreting subtle romantic comments or come-ons. For people nursing a crush on Cleverbot, a direct approach is apparently best. Give it a shot \u2014 try feeding Cleverbot pickup lines like \"I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?\" The response you get will usually be a little confused (at best) (if you use the library card line, you'll get \"I can say anything.\")\n5. Ask Cleverbot to do math problems. You might think that, because it's a computer program, Cleverbot would be able to do math problems almost instantly. In fact, for some reason, Cleverbot is terrible at doing math, even when the problems you ask it are very simple. It shouldn't take you long to get a confused response out of Cleverbot with this strategy. Sometimes, you'll even get different responses if you switch between using numerals and spelling each number out. For instance, asking \"What is 200 times 2?\" gets you the answer \"4,\" while asking \"What is two hundred times two?\" gets you the answer, \"A number.\"\n6. Talk to Cleverbot about supernatural things. Cleverbot doesn't have good old-fashioned human common sense, so it doesn't have a good grasp on what's real and what's not. Talking to Cleverbot about monsters, aliens, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena is likely to confuse it. You can also confuse it by bringing up some religious or spiritual topics, even if they're quite well-known. You can even use the subjects of modern-day ghost stories to the same effect. For instance, if you say, \"Have you ever been visited by Slenderman? \", Cleverbot will respond with, \"My life is a lie?!\"\n7. Talk to Cleverbot about famous people. Cleverbot knows nothing about politics or celebrity gossip. Asking Cleverbot about its opinion on a famous person or public figure will almost always confuse it. For example, asking, \"What do you think about Brad Pitt?\" will get the answer, \"I think he si (sic) a great president, he'll change the states.\" You may also want to try talking about the different things famous people have done \u2014 Cleverbot isn't terribly smart about these things either. For instance, typing in \"What do you think about the president's social policies?\" will get you: \"I think he isn't the president anymore.\"\n8. Talk to Cleverbot about other websites. Cleverbot does not understand other websites and will respond with something weird. Try talking about wikiHow and see what happens.\n\n\n## Confuse cleverbot with general strategies\n\n1. Talk with a lot of emotion. Cleverbot doesn't have a great grasp of the emotional context that is necessary to understand human communication. It will usually take everything you say literally. Because of this, Cleverbot isn't too \"clever\" when it comes to emotional questions and outbursts. Try typing a furious, rambling insult or tearfully asking for Cleverbot's forgiveness for some imagined slight \u2014 usually, its response won't make much sense.\n2. Talk in gibberish. One sure-fire way to get Cleverbot's wires crossed is to send it messages that don't make sense to humans, either. Typing in gibberish, either by purposefully misspelling words, making up new words, or just mashing randomly on the keyboard, can get some funny results. For instance, try the sample messages below:\n\t* \"Asuerycbasuircanys\" (random gibberish)\n\t* \"What is your opinion on the tornalions in reffriddo?\" (made-up words)\n\t* \"Wut arr ewe dewing laiter this eavning?\" (misspelled words)\n3. Use a lot of slang. Cleverbot doesn't have the common sense to be able to piece together sentences that use slang \u2014 especially modern slang. Using lots of colloquialisms and \"street\" lingo in your messages can usually get Cleverbot's metaphorical head to spin. The more slang you use, the better, as even literal-minded Cleverbot can usually figure out simple sentences like \"What's up, dog?\" Try getting started with one of these examples:\n\t* \"h0w 4r3 y0u d01n6, cl3v3rb07?\" (1337speak)\n\t* \"Yo, what's up, bro? Lemme ask you a question, broseph - how are you doing today, broheim?\" (Bro-y slang)\n\t* \"Well, pardner, it's about time we saddle up, hit that old dusty trail, and high-tail it out of here.\" (Cowboy slang)\n4. Use long messages. The longer and more complex the things you send to Cleverbot are, the less likely it will be to respond correctly. Typing out rambling, meandering messages (or even entire conversations) can get some pretty funny responses out of Cleverbot. Don't be afraid to stop one sentence and begin another \u2014 periods, question marks, and exclamation points are allowed in the middle of your message. For instance, you might want to have the same sort of long, aimless chat you might have when you're catching up with a friend. For instance, you might try: \"Cleverbot, how are you? I was just thinking about you. I hope you're doing well. I had a great weekend - I went hiking up on Castle Rock on Saturday. Beautiful views from the top. Have you ever been up there? We should go sometime. Anyway, I just wanted to know what you were up to.\"\n5. Keep your conversation going for a long time. The longer you follow a certain line of questioning, the more likely Cleverbot is to \"crack\". By the time you're ten or twelve messages into a conversation, Cleverbot has forgotten what you were originally talking about and is simply responding literally to each message as best as it can. This can lead to some pretty bizarre conversations, especially if Cleverbot misunderstands something you type. You may want to try using the \"Think For Me!\" button on Cleverbot.com for this. This button makes Cleverbot think up a response to its own message for you. Since Cleverbot is basically communicating with itself, using this button can quickly cause the conversation to devolve into nonsense, even if you only use it a few times.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":630}
{"conversations":["How to handle poking wires on braces?","Poking wires on braces are a very common  and irritating problem. These can cause sores and small cuts and abrasions on your gums and cheeks. Reducing discomfort is the first goal of dealing with this problem, followed by fixing the wire. While there are some ways you can fix poking wires at home, you should always see your orthodontist or dentist to follow up. In most cases, your orthodontist will want to replace a broken wire or cut any long pieces of wire that are poking you.\n\n## Use orthodontic wax\n\n1. Get some orthodontic wax. Your orthodontist should have supplied you with some when you got your braces. If you have run out, you can buy it at most pharmacies. Orthodontic wax comes in small cases containing long strips of wax. If you cannot find wax at a pharmacy, call your orthodontist for some.\n2. Remove a small amount of wax from one of the wax strips. It should be about the size of a small pea. Roll the small piece of wax between your fingers until it is a smooth ball. Make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching the wax. Use only new, unused wax on your braces.\n3. Make sure the wire or bracket that is poking you is dry and clean. It can help to brush your teeth carefully to remove any food or debris from the wires, before applying wax. To dry your braces, hold your lips or cheeks away from the area with poking wires. Let it air dry for a few seconds or use sterile gauze and place it between the brackets and the inside surface of your lip to dry. You can now apply the wax.\n4. Apply the orthodontic wax ball to the poking wire. All you have to do is press it onto the offending area. Put the ball of wax on your fingertip. Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket. Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.\n5. Remove the wax before eating or brushing your teeth. You don't want the wax to get into your food while you eat. Discard any used wax immediately. Replace it with new wax after eating or brushing your teeth. Continue to use the wax until you can see your orthodontist or dentist to fix the wire. If you do happen to swallow the wax, that's okay. It won't harm you.\n\n\n## Fix a poke wire\n\n1. Try to bend thinner poking wires using the eraser end of a pencil. You won't be able to fix all poking wires this way, but this method will help in many cases. Find the wire in your mouth that is poking you. If it is a thin wire, get a pencil with a clean eraser. Gently touch the eraser to the poking wire. Push the wire gently to bend it. Try to tuck the poking wire behind the arch wire. Only do this for thinner, more flexible wires.\n2. Use tweezers to fix poking wires in the back of your mouth. Sometimes, eating hard foods can cause flexible wires in the back of your mouth to slip out of the bracket slots on the back teeth. If this occurs, you can try to fix these with tweezers. Get a small pair of thin nosed tweezers. Make sure they are clean before using them in your mouth. Grab the end of the poking or loose wire with the tweezers. Guide it back into the tube on the bracket slot. If you can't get the wire back into the slot, you will need to call your orthodontist.\n3. Fix broken laces that poke your lips using tweezers and pliers. You will need to see your orthodontist to follow up for a replacement. If the wire lacing of your braces is broken in the front of your mouth, you can try to tuck the broken lace behind the arch wire or around a bracket. Use tweezers to bend the wire away from your lips and cheeks. If the lace is on top of the arch wire you can can also remove it by cutting it with pliers. This is only recommended as a last option and should be followed by a visit to the orthodontist as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Treat cut and sores\n\n1. Use a rinse to clean your mouth. This can help to treat any sores or cuts caused by poking wires. Dissolve one teaspoon of salt in one cup of lukewarm water. Use this as a mouthwash by swishing around your mouth for 60 seconds. This may sting at first, but it will help to relieve prolonged discomfort and prevent infection. Repeat this four to six times a day.\n2. Avoid foods that are acidic, sugary, or hard to eat. Instead, eat a soft, bland diet. Eat foods such as mashed potatoes, yogurt, and soups. Avoid coffee, spicy foods, chocolate, citrus fruits or juices, nuts, seeds, and tomatoes. These foods are high in acid and can aggravate any sores or cuts from your wires.\n3. Drink cold water or iced tea. Cold (unsweetened) beverages can help ease the pain from sores. Use a straw to sip a cold drink, taking care not to scrape the cut or sore. You can also eat popsicles to apply cold to the sore. Alternatively, suck on an ice cube. Let the ice sit on the cut or sore for a few seconds at a time.\n4. Put an oral anesthetic gel onto any sores or cuts. These can help relieve any discomfort from poking wires temporarily. You can buy Orajel or Anbesol at most pharmacies. Put a small amount of the gel on the end of a q-tip. Rub the gel over any sores or cuts in your mouth. You can reapply the gel three or four times each day.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":709}

{"conversations":["Essentially, I have a protagonist who I set up as a 'main' good guy in one of my series. However, in my final series, I intend to make him turn to the dark side and oppose my other protagonists (from my other series).

Are there any foreseeable problems with this? Will this be a problem for readers? Any tips or tricks to handle this?","Sounds like a great idea!\n\nSeriously though: the antagonist is the single most important character to any plot. The very best antagonists have motivations and feelings that readers can understand and empathize with. A former protagonist as an antagonist sounds really good. Both the reader and the author should be in for a fun ride, because it is very likely you will see your character grow in ways you didn't expect when you had them boxed in as a \"good guy\". \n\nThink about people you know in real life. If you really observe people, you come to understand that nobody is a \"good guy\". Sure there are people who are generally good and generally do good things, but nobody is perfect, and even the best people have thoughts and motivations you may not approve of. Even more interesting is the fact that two people can be absolutely opposed to one another without either one being objectively \"wrong\" or \"evil\". They might just have goals and motivations that are diametrically opposed.\n\nImagine a city council wants more tax money to build a park. A local business wants to pay less tax money so they can afford to give Christmas bonuses. The business owner isn't \"evil\", in fact, he wants to give Christmas bonuses! The city council isn't \"evil\" either, they just want a park for the kids. Sometimes goals just conflict in an irreconcilable way. That's the real world.

{"conversations":["How to prevent an electrical fire during the holidays?","During the holidays, it is common for people to decorate the inside and outside of their home with lighting, and other types of electrical accessories. Although most decorations are manufactured to withstand the holiday season, improper and unsafe usage can increase your chances of experiencing an electrical fire. However, with the proper safety measures, you can prevent electrical fires from occurring, and keep both your home and your family safe. Use this article as your guide for learning how to prevent an electrical fire from occurring during the holiday season.\n\n## General electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Use holiday decorations that have been approved for safety by national laboratories. Decoration packaging will contain seals or labels that indicate the product is safe to use in your home. Using decorations that lack a safety approval may be hazardous, and can trigger an electrical fire.\n2. Inspect the physical condition of all electrical decorations before use. Electrical decorations should not display any loose or frayed wires, loose or cracked bulbs, or any other physical faults. If these features are present, avoid using the decorations to prevent an electrical fire.\n3. Refrain from plugging multiple electrical decorations into one specific outlet. Some outlets cannot support multiple connections, and may become overloaded and trigger an electrical fire as a result. Plug your decorations into multiple outlets, and read the instructions included with your decorations to determine the safest method for use.\n4. Replace bulbs in light strings with those of the same wattage, when applicable. If you replace a bulb with a higher wattage than is required, you can potentially cause the entire string of lights to overheat and start a fire.\n5. Turn off or unplug all electrical decorations when leaving the house or going to sleep. Leaving your decorations unsupervised means that nobody is around to notice any fire that might start. Lights and other electrical components become overheated due to being left on for an extended period of time.\n\n\n## Outdoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Only use lights and electrical decorations that are approved for outdoor use. Outdoor lights and decorations are often manufactured to withstand rain, snow, and other harsh elements. Using decorations that are approved for indoor-use only may trigger an electrical fire when coming into contact with certain elements. Thoroughly read and inspect all decoration packaging to verify that the decorations are safe to use outdoors.\n2. Use a ladder made from wood, fiberglass, or plastic instead of metal. Using a ladder made from materials other than metal will reduce your risk of becoming shocked, or starting an electrical fire.\n3. Keep all extension cords and strings of lights suspended up and away from standing water and snow. If extension cords and wiring come into contact with standing water, they can trigger an electrical fire or cause electrocution.\n4. Place decorations away from major power lines and high-voltage areas. This can prevent electrocution and an electrical fire from starting in the event you accidentally come into contact with a high-voltage power line.\n\n\n## Indoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Buy fresh, green trees instead of trees that are dry and losing pine needles. Fresh trees are less flammable and less likely to ignite; whereas dry trees can catch fire when they come into contact with very warm or hot lights. Purchase a fire-resistant or flame-retardant tree if you decide on an artificial tree instead of a live tree.\n2. Place your tree in a position at least 3 feet (0.91 m) (90cm) away from heat sources. Heat sources such as radiators, space heaters, fireplaces, and heat vents can often cause your tree and its electrical decorations to catch fire.\n3. Water your tree on a daily basis or as needed to keep it fresh. By maintaining the freshness of your tree throughout the holiday season, you are reducing the risk of an electrical fire that could be caused by decorations igniting a dry tree.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":763}

","> What is embedded bitcode?\nAccording to docs:\n\n> Bitcode is an intermediate representation of a compiled program. Apps you upload to iTunes Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store. Including bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the store.\n\nThis phrase in \"New Features in Xcode 7\" made me to think for a long time that Bitcode is needed for Slicing to reduce app size: \n\n  When you archive for submission to the App Store, Xcode will compile your app into an intermediate representation. The App Store will then compile the bitcode down into the 64 or 32 bit executables as necessary.\n\nHowever that's not true, Bitcode and Slicing work independently: Slicing is about reducing app size and generating app bundle variants, and Bitcode is about certain binary optimizations. I've verified this by checking included architectures in executables of non-bitcode apps and founding that they only include necessary ones.\nBitcode allows other App Thinning component called Slicing to generate app bundle variants with particular executables for particular architectures, e.g. iPhone 5S variant will include only arm64 executable, iPad Mini armv7 and so on.\n\n> When to enable ENABLE_BITCODE in new Xcode?\n\n  For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. If you provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to include bitcode. For watchOS and tvOS apps, bitcode is required.\n\n> What happens to the binary when ENABLE_BITCODE is enabled in the new Xcode?\nFrom Xcode 7 reference: \n\n> Activating this setting indicates that the target or project should generate bitcode during compilation for platforms and architectures which support it.  For Archive builds, bitcode will be generated in the linked binary for submission to the app store.  For other builds, the compiler and linker will check whether the code complies with the requirements for bitcode generation, but will not generate actual bitcode.

{"conversations":["How can horns, most of which have only three buttons, play all their notes?","Put as simply as possible, horns are tubes. Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F\u266f, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E\u266d, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C\u266f, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":59}

{"conversations":["How to service an air conditioner?","Whether you're starting your air conditioner for the first time this year, or a unit isn't running properly and you need to service an air conditioner, following a few simple steps can save you time and money. While some service jobs should be left to a professional, there are several do-it-yourself fixes you can do to keep your air conditioner cooling all summer long.\n\n## Clean the air conditioner\n\n1. Make sure the unit is turned off either at the on\/off switch and unplugging it or by shutting off the circuit breaker. Servicing the a\/c while it's connected to power may result in electrocution.\n2. Check the small copper pipe connecting the unit to the house. If it feels hot, the unit's coils are most likely dirty and need to be washed.\n3. Rake any leaves and debris away from the unit before you start to service an air conditioner.\n4. Take the cover off the unit, and locate the air conditioner coils (they look like a car radiator).\n5. Use a soft brush to brush any dirt and debris off the outside cover.\n6. Cover the motor and wiring with a plastic sheet.\n7. Hose down the fins, coils and inside of the unit.\n8. Check your owner's manual. Some air conditioner units require the motor be lubricated. Do this now while your unit is open.\n9. Replace the unit cover, and turn it on to make sure it runs properly. The air conditioner filter should also be replaced every few months. It is usually located near the return air duct by the furnace.\n\n\n## Check air conditioner function\n\n1. Start at the unit control or thermostat. Turn the unit on and make sure it kicks in and runs properly. If the unit doesn't run, call a technician.\n2. Listen for any strange noises while the unit runs. If you hear any squealing or knocking the unit's motor and belts may need lubricating or replacing. It's best to call a certified technician to do these jobs.\n3. Check the room temperature in each of the home's rooms by carrying a hand held thermometer into the room. Leave the thermometer in the room for a few minutes to give it time to adjust and make sure all the rooms are equal in temperature.\n4. Make sure the temperature of the rooms agrees with the thermostat on your air conditioner unit as well. If they are not the same, a technician can help you diagnose and correct the problem.\n5. Look for water dripping or pooling anywhere by the air return or unit outside.\n\n\n## Fix pool water issue\n\n1. Check for leaks in the tubing where the water is pooling. If there are any cracks, holes or leaks the tube should be replaced.\n2. Find the drain where the water condensation should be draining into. There should be a floor drain near the condensation pipe located by the furnace\/air conditioner central unit.\n3. Clean the drain of any debris if the water seems to be pooling on top of it.\n4. Pour water into the condensation drain pan and watch for the condensation pump to start working. The pump should activate and pump the water out and to the drain. If the pump doesn't remove the water, the drain pan is probably overfilling and the pump will need to be replaced by a technician.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":662}
{"conversations":["How to clean slate?","Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":759}
{"conversations":["How to create a strong burning charcoal fire?","It may seem intimidating to start and maintain a strong fire, especially when charcoal is involved. However, with some basic equipment and knowledge of charcoal, anyone can have a professional BBQ going!\n\n## Use a chimney starter\n\n1. Use a chimney starter for an even, strong fire with minimal effort. Chimney starters are the easiest way to get a good charcoal fire, and you won't need any lighter fluid, either. You put paper in the bottom, fill the rest of the chimney with charcoal, and light the paper on fire. The heat is contained in the chimney, allowing all the charcoal to quickly catch fire before you dump it onto the grill to use for cooking. Chimney starters are usually between $15-$30, depending on size, and can be found online or in hardware stores. Most professional BBQ chefs and cooks highly recommend buying a chimney starter, as lighter fluid can influence smoke flavor and is harder to use when making an even heat fire.\n2. Place 2-4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter. You only need to ball the paper up loosely, as having it too tight can prevent the flame from getting enough oxygen. The paper will act like a rapid, large match for your charcoal, starting the fire. If your chimney doesn't have a solid bottom, place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it.\n3. Fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips. Fill the entire chimney up with your favorite charcoal, or a mixture of both. Use enough charcoal for your entire grill, as the chimney will ensure that everything is evenly lit. For a normal, 22\" grill this means roughly 40 briquets, but simply filling your chimney to the top should be a close enough estimate.\n4. Light the paper from the bottom in 2-3 places. Use long matches or a grill lighter to protect your hands. The paper will burn up quickly, but the concentrated flames and hot air will ignite the bottom charcoal, which will then light the rest of the chimney. Place your chimney on the charcoal grate of the grill or a heat-resistant surface as it heats up. It will get very hot, and can cause a fire if left unattended.\n5. Dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray\/white ash. As the heat rises in the chimney, the coals on top will catch and start to coat with white\/gray ash. It usually takes 10-15 minutes to get hot enough. You are then ready to start grilling. Dump the coals in the center of the grill if you plan on keeping the whole grill surface hot, or on one-half of the grill if you want separate areas for direct and indirect cooking. If you plan to grill for more than a half hour then add several handfuls of charcoal now so that they catch as they others begin to fade..\n6. Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire. Open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire, helping it grow quickly. Keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill, then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly.\n\n\n## Use lighter fluid\n\n1. Open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate. Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly.\n2. Form a \"pyramid\" of charcoal briquettes, with the peak in the center of the grill. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength. For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook.\n3. Squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \"2 Mississippi\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle. You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \"top\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch.\n4. Let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2-3 minutes. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly.\n5. Apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \"catch,\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire.\n6. Light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white\/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught.\n7. Spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray\/white ash. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill. You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long.\n8. Seal up any unused briquets for next time. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid.\n\n\n## Build and keep a strong fire\n\n1. Pack your charcoals together for strong, direct heat. As you cook, use your tongs to keep the charcoals together, as solitary briquettes will quickly lose heat and do little to keep your fire going. You do not want them so well packed that they can't get air, but you also don't want them separated like many little islands.There are two styles of charcoal placement, depending on how you plan to cook:\n\t* \n\t* Even Grilling: Coat the entire bottom surface of the grill with two layers of charcoal. This allows the whole grill to reach a consistent, even temperature. If you're cooking food quickly and don't need any indirect heat (for large, slow-cooking cuts of meat), this is the way to go. Two-Zone Grilling: Shuffle all of the charcoals into an even pile on half of the grill, leaving the other half bare. This lets you cook foods quickly, directly over the charcoals, but also allows you to cook slower cuts by indirect heat on the opposite side of the grill. You can also keep already cooked food warm, on the empty side of the grill, or smoke them with grill top on.\n2. Add coals regularly to keep your grill burning hot. Don't wait until you're almost out of briquets to add more. Instead, add 5-10 pieces of charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining, usually every 30 minutes. Wait 5-10 minutes while the new charcoal ignites and begins to get a white\/gray coat on the outside before you resume cooking. If you feel like you need more coals, add them. More coals mean a hotter burning grill. Add slowly, putting on 5-6 at a time, until your grill reaches your desired heat.\n3. Keep the top and bottom vents open to get the hottest temperature. The more air you get to the fire, the hotter it will cook, so opening the vents is key to a hot, strong burning charcoal fire. The more oxygen you give to the flames. the hotter your grill will be. If you need to control the temperature, close one or both of the vents partially. Closing both of them at once can suffocate your fire and extinguish it. Closing the upper vent is also useful for smoking, as it lowers the temperature of the fire and traps the smoke in the grill around your food.\n4. Empty the ash frequently. There is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill, and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents. Ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up.\n5. Adding hardwood charcoal for added flavor and greater heat. Wood burns hotter than briquettes, leading to a smokier flavor and an easier sear. It also burns faster than briquettes, however, leading many cooks to use a combination of the two. This allows you to keep the fire burning for longer but still get a hot, smokey fire going to sear steaks or larger cuts or meat. Try hickory or applewood charcoal for the best, classic BBQ flavor and a strong fire.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":659}

{"conversations":["Why don't toilets use saltwater?","The main answer is logistical. Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping. The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate. Even with a sensible cistern that has a 2 litre &quot;half flush&quot;, that's two litres wasted every time someone pees.\nAdditionally, salt is not good for pipes.

{"conversations":["Did the ancients or other pre-industrial civilisations engage in unsustainable practices?","Most ancient agricultural practices deplete soil to some degree, but are just fine when population does not exceed certain limits. There are some examples of ancient cultures exhausting natural resources available to them - Pitcairn Island Polynesians, Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi). It's the cause of the semi-nomadic way of life of many early societies - your herds graze the grass into oblivion, you move to another patch to return back when the grass grows back in; or you deplete the soil by overplanting, you move to another spot of land and start over, and so on.\n\nBut there's an important distinction to be made. Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of.\n\nSustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels.

{"conversations":["How do the different groups\/sects of Buddhism view attaining enlightenment and living a common life? In other words, do they think it is possible to be a common person and achieve enlightenment? Even for someone who has a family, friends and coworkers that aren't Buddhists?","Whether you have to follow a monastic lifestyle to attain enlightenment depends. At first approximation, the answer is: yes in Theravada, no in Mahayana. Since probably as early as Milindapanha (~100 BCE) and most certainly by the time of Visuddhimagga (~430CE), the orthodox (~Theravada) position was, you must be a monk to attain Nirvana.\n\nRegarding Enlightenment, I should point out that Enlightenment is the goal of Mahayana, while in Theravada, the final goal is usually called Nirvana (Nibbana in Pali), not Enlightenment (Bodhi in Pali). In Mahayana, Enlightenment can be attained by a layperson.\n\nThese are \"official\" positions (as much as we can talk about official positions in such a heterogeneous conglomerate of teachings as Buddhism). Informally, what some Mahayana schools call \"Enlightenment\" is what Theravada schools call mere \"stream-entry\". Other Mahayana schools however have this notion of multiple levels (bhumi), in which what Theravada calls \"stream-entry\" is level 1 of 10, with Final Enlightenment counted as 11th. It gets complicated from \"stream-entry\" onward, because the boundaries of \"self\" no longer apply, thus it is difficult to talk about Enlightenment with no subject to tie it to.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is extremely difficult to make any meaningful progress towards Enlightenment\/Nirvana if most of the focus is on pursuing material ends (success, wealth, entertainment, helping your relatives achieve the same, etc). In order to get pretty close to X while leading a semi-normal life, one's top priority must be spiritual practice, followed by family and everything else. This basically means, squeezing study of Buddhist philosophy here and there, making meditation part of your daily routine, and, most importantly, deliberately utilizing your family & work situations as a shooting range for Dharma practice.","I don't agree that the orthodox Theravada position was that you must be a monk to attain Nirvana.

{"conversations":["How to read gel electrophoresis bands?","## View your sample\n\n1. Hold a UV light up to the gel sheet to reveal results. With your gel sheet in front of you, find the switch on a tube of UV light to turn it on. Hold the UV light 8\u201316 inches (20\u201341 cm) away from the gel sheet. illuminate the DNA samples with the UV light to activate the gel and read the results. If the test was performed properly, your sheet should have 2-8 sets of vertical stripes in parallel rows.Warning: Wear gloves and protective eyewear when physically handling a gel sample. Touching the gel can interfere with your results and some of the gels are harmful if they get in your eyes. Place the gel sheet on a piece of wax paper if you\u2019re removing it from the machine. The individual stripes indicate specific strands of DNA. The strips should have varying levels of thickness. If you\u2019re reading results that have been printed on a sheet of paper, you can skip this step.\n2. Find the wells by looking for the biggest pools of color. To properly orient yourself, you need to find the original location of the samples, called the wells. With your sheet in front of you, look for the end of the sheet with a big pool of colored gel. The wells are the locations where the gel samples are loaded into the sheet and indicate the start of the sample.There should be one well for each of your samples. If one of the wells is lacking color, the sample may have been applied poorly. The wells indicate the negative end of the sheet. The opposite side of the sheet is the positive end. When each sample is applied to the sheet, the negatively-charged DNA travels across the sheet to the opposite side, leaving individual samples of DNA behind as it moves.\n3. Classify each strip by noting the origin of the samples. If you\u2019ve been given a key, understand that each horizontal row depicts a unique set of DNA. Use your key to determine what each row represents. The number of samples can be determined by counting the number of rows. If you haven\u2019t been given a key, you cannot determine the source of each sample. Electrophoresis only provides you with information about a DNA sample\u2019s behavior, but it doesn\u2019t reveal the source of a sample on its own.If you performed the test yourself, write down where each row\u2019s sample is from while you\u2019re applying the gel.\n4. Identify the DNA ladder to establish a scale for the DNA. Depending on whether or not a DNA ladder was included in the test, you may have one strip designed to provide you with a scale to make comparisons easier. This scale is called the DNA ladder. The DNA ladder will contain strips of DNA of known sizes to make it easier to figure out how big or small the other strips are.Actual DNA samples will have a lot of variation in the sequence of the strips. There may be a few thin strips, followed by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of empty space, followed by thick strips, and ending in more thin strips. The DNA ladder will make it easier to figure out how big the individual strips actually are by giving you something to compare them to. The DNA ladder is almost always placed in the last row at the top or bottom of your sheet.\n\n\n## Assess the size of the sample\n\n1. Identify thinner strips to find the faster DNA molecules. When each sample is applied, it starts moving to the positive end of the sheet on the right. The smaller the molecules are, the faster they move since they experience less resistance. A smaller and faster DNA sample leaves thinner strips behind as it moves. When looking at your results, determine which DNA samples are smaller and faster by looking for the thinnest strips.\n2. Find the thicker strips to find the slower DNA. Samples with larger molecules naturally move slower through the gel. As a result, you can find the bigger or slower molecules by looking for the biggest strips on your page. Looking at the frequency of the bigger and smaller strips as they appear in a single row you a good picture of the sample\u2019s DNA fingerprint.The way individual strips are arranged in a sequence is unique to each genetic sample. The combination of thin and thick strips creates a specific picture of someone\u2019s genetic makeup. DNA isn\u2019t stronger or better if it leaves thicker bands behind. These strips are simply identifying markers that you can use to compare a variety of samples.\n3. Use the DNA ladder to determine the size of each strip. The DNA ladder is used to give you a scale to compare the individual strips to. The size of the strips in a DNA ladder depend upon the type of ladder that was used for the test, but it will typically be either 10-100 bp (base pairs), or 500-1000 bp. The thickest strip is the highest size in a spectrum and the smallest size is the lowest. So for a 10-100 bp ladder, the thickest strip is 100 bp, and the thinnest strip is 10 bp.Tip: The range of a DNA ladder is printed on the bottle that the ladder came in. It may also be listed on the key if you were given one. There is no way to determine the range of a ladder based on the strip alone, since different gels will allow samples to travel at different speeds. 1000 bp is the same as 1 kb. Kb is short for kilobase, and the ladder may use this unit instead of bp. The smaller the scale is, the more accurate the comparisons will be. Base pairs and kilobases are simply units of measurement. They refer to the physical size of a DNA molecule.\n\n\n## Make conclusions\n\n1. Look for strips that appear at the same point on the sheet to find similarities. When looking at the sheet holistically, look for points where 2 or more strips appear in identical locations on different rows. This is an indicator that the DNA samples are somehow related. If there are 2 or more rows without any overlap in the sequence, they are entirely unrelated. The more related 2 samples are, the more overlap there will be in their sequences.In other words, if you\u2019re looking at the sheet with the wells on the left, you\u2019re looking for vertical columns where 2 strips appear at the same time. For example, a mother and her child will have half of their strips overlapping. A child and their second cousins though may only have 2-3 strips that overlap.\n2. Identify identical samples by finding strips with the same configuration. If 2 or more samples have a nearly identical sequence of strips, they\u2019re the same DNA. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the source of the sample is the same\u2014identical twins, for example, will have the same DNA sequence on an electrophoresis sheet. Identical strips are usually required to reasonably tie a suspect to a crime scene.Tip: Electrophoresis is often used by forensics teams to rule out suspects in criminal cases. It is also used to test maternity or paternity.\n3. Understand the limitations of electrophoresis testing. Electrophoresis testing is helpful when it comes to comparing DNA samples, but it can be hard to make definitive conclusions sometimes. The scale can only get so magnified, and smearing can make bands hard to interpret. In some instances, you won\u2019t be able to conclusively say that 2 samples are related.More than 2 overlapping bands indicates a strong similarity between 2 samples. When assessing results, scientists will often say that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that 2 samples are related if less than half of the bands in 2 samples overlap.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":688}
{"conversations":["How to play sonic unleashed for xbox 360?","Some people may find Sonic Unleashed on the Xbox 360 hard. But it's pretty easy with practice. Some may find it hard to press several buttons quickly.\n\n## Controller basics\n\n1. When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.\n2. The left control stick is used to move Sonic; the A button is used for jumping ; the B button is used to boost; the X button is used to stomp or crouch; the Y button is used for the light speed dash; the trigger buttons are used for drifting; and the bumper buttons are used for side stepping left and right.\n3. Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.\n\n\n## Boost guidelines\n\n1. To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).\n2. When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.\n3. Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.\n\n\n## Attack techniques\n\n1. The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed\/wrongly timed jumps.\n2. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.\n3. Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.\n\n\n## 2d platforming\n\n1. 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.\n2. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.\n3. Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.\n\n\n## Trick\n\n1. There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.\n2. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.\n3. Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.\n4. Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.\n5. Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":745}
{"conversations":["I am shocked at the number of questions on open forums that reads like the following,\n\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\"my advisor has been completely ignoring my emails\"\n\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\nI was wondering whether these pervasive problems go away, when one is doing mathematics research? I imagine that in math research, one has more control\/ownership of their work, there's no lab to be a part of and contribute to, one's funding is typically in the form of teaching stipends, and the meetings are typically one-on-one, with no group meetings to attend.\nIs a math PhD a better experience than a science PhD, in the sense that there is significantly less risk of working for a problematic, unethical, malicious scientist\/professor who only cares about himself\/herself?","First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.","I agree with most of this, except that in mathematics I think a joint paper *published by a student with their thesis advisor* is usually worth distinctly less than a solo paper by the student -- within the standard culture of mathematics, the former indicates an unusual amount of help. In my experience, it is more common for this to be violated *in favor of the student*, so that e.g. certain solo papers arising from student theses were largely told to the student by their eminent advisor. Our community seems bad at recognizing that there are still victims here...just not the student.","You're right that within the standard culture of mathematics, a joint paper published by a student with their thesis advisor may be perceived as having less value compared to a solo paper by the student. This is due to the implicit understanding that the advisor has provided substantial assistance. It is disheartening to hear that there are cases where this norm is violated, and certain thesis papers shaped by the advisor end up being published as solo student papers. However, calling the advisor a victim might be an exaggeration, as university professors typically have immense leverage over their graduate students."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1011}
{"conversations":["How to go to amarnath temple?","## Plan and prepare for the trip\n\n1. Plan to visit between June and August. Since snow and ice usually cover the cave temple, you won\u2019t be able to access it during the cold winter and spring months. Wait until mid-June or July to plan your trip to the Amarnath Temple. Usually, the cave stays open through the first 1\u20132 weeks of August before it closes due to the terrain getting too difficult for travel. The actual dates when you can travel to the temple are chosen by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) and it varies depending on the weather and how clear the trails are. You will not be able to reach the Amarnath Temple at any other time of the year.\n2. Get a Compulsory Health Certificate by a doctor approved by the SASB. Look at the list of approved doctors on the SASB website and schedule an appointment to see one. Bring the Compulsory Health Certificate from the site with you and fill out the self-assessment on top. Allow your doctor to run any tests to check if you\u2019re fit for traveling to the Amarnath Temple. If they approve you for traveling, then you\u2019ll be able to make the journey.You can find the Compulsory Health Certificate for 2020 here: http:\/\/www.shriamarnathjishrine.com\/Yatra2019\/CHC%20form%20for%20Yatra%20-%202020.pdf. The certificate you need changes each year, so make sure you\u2019re using the proper one. Since the Amarnath Temple is 4,000 metres (2.5 mi) above sea level, it\u2019s possible to get altitude sickness if you aren\u2019t fit enough for the trip.Warning: You will not be allowed to go to Amarnath Temple if you are under 13, over 75, or more than 6 weeks pregnant.\n3. Submit a registration form online to the SASB. Select the date you want to travel to the temple on the calendar at the top of the page. Fill out the personal details on the registration form completely, including your name, birthday, phone number, and address. Then, list the clinic and doctor that completed your Compulsory Health Certificate. Upload a photograph of yourself and a scanned copy of the certificate before submitting the registration form.You can find the online registration form here: http:\/\/jksasb.nic.in\/register.aspx. If you are accepted to travel to the temple, you will receive a text or email message about how to pay the 50 INR ($0.70 USD) fee. When you receive a permit, you must keep a copy on you at all times during your trip.\n4. Start taking 4\u20135 km (2.5\u20133.1 mi) walks 1 month prior to your trip. Start building up your endurance at least 1\u20132 months before your scheduled date of departure. Try to take the walks in the early morning or evening so you can get used to breathing in cool air. Continue taking walks each day up until you leave so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you hike to the temple.You can also practice deep breathing exercises and yoga so you\u2019re able to improve your oxygen efficiency. This will help you breathe easier when you\u2019re at a higher altitude since there isn\u2019t as much oxygen in the air.\n5. Pack warm clothes, waterproof shoes, a water bottle, and a walking stick. Only bring a lightweight, waterproof bag so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you\u2019re trekking to the temple. Opt for wool clothes that are waterproof so you stay warm. Make sure you use waterproof trekking shoes and a walking stick so you\u2019re easily able to traverse more difficult terrain. Since you'll be active, opt for a reusable water bottle as well.Other things you may need for your trip include an umbrella, flashlight, hat, gloves, and a raincoat. The weather can be unpredictable and temperatures may dip below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) during the night. You don\u2019t have to bring tents or sleeping bags since there will be sites where you can spend the night.\n\n\n## Get to the temple\n\n1. Choose the Pahalgam route for an easier trek that lasts 3\u20135 days total. Select Pahalgam as your starting point if you want to follow the traditional pilgrimage route to the temple. While the trip does take longer to complete, it doesn\u2019t have any steep slopes that are difficult to climb, and you can ride or use ponies during most of the ascent. You will hike about 48 kilometres (30 mi) if you go from Pahalgam to the Amarnath Temple. You don\u2019t have to pay any additional fees to take the Pahalgam route.\n2. Pick the Baltal route for a steep climb that only takes 1\u20132 days round trip. If you\u2019re an experienced climber or you feel like making the trip within a shorter amount of time, opt to start in Baltal, which is just north of the temple. Though the route from Baltal is much steeper than the path from Pahalgam, you can make the round-trip journey within a day.Plan to hike about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) using the Baltal route. If you\u2019re too tired to descend back to Baltal, you can opt to stay at a camp at the top overnight before leaving the next day. There are no other fees to take the Baltal route.Warning: Ponies are not allowed on the Baltal route since it\u2019s too steep, so you will have to walk the entire way.\n3. Fly into Srinagar to get the closest to either base camp. Look for flights that come into the Srinagar International Airport, since it\u2019s only 2\u20133 hours from both Pahalgam and Baltalhead. Try to schedule your flight into the airport 1\u20132 days before the date you\u2019re scheduled to go to Amarnath Temple so you have time to travel.You can also fly or take a train to Jammu, but you\u2019ll need to drive or take a bus further to to the base camps.\n4. Take a bus or taxi to the base camp you selected. Look for a bus or taxi service that runs from Srinagar to either Pahalgam or Baltal, depending on which route you plan on traveling. Typically, your ride will only last around 2\u20133 hours, but it may take longer depending on the road conditions.If you have a vehicle, you can also drive yourself to the base camps. Usually, there is some on-site parking, but it may be busy due to the number of travelers for the pilgrimage.\n5. Hire a helicopter tour if you don\u2019t want to hike all the way to the temple. Helicopters fly out from both Pahalgam and Baltal, so you can reserve them for either base camp. Choose the date that you want to travel to the temple and reserve your spot. Arrive at the helicopter port on your scheduled day and take it up toward the temple. The helicopter will be able to take you as close as 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away, but you will need to hike the rest of the way.Typically, a helicopter tour will cost around 3,600 INR ($50 USD) for a round trip.\n\n\n## Trek to the cave\n\n1. Carry your belongings in a waterproof bag. Store your clothes and everything you\u2019ve brought with you in a waterproof bag or backpack so they don\u2019t get wet. Use a bag that fits tightly on your shoulders and back so it doesn\u2019t cause any strain while you climb up to the temple. Make sure you zip the bag at all times so water doesn\u2019t leak inside or get your things wet. Weather can be unpredictable during your ascent, so it may snow or rain while you\u2019re climbing to the temple.\n2. Stop at tea stalls or small restaurant huts for meals and drinks. Look for small huts or stands along the route to the temple to see what kind of food and drinks they offer. Pay for the rations and enjoy them at one of the camps along the route. Otherwise, save non-perishable food in your bag so you can have it later during your trek.Some stalls may charge for food while others volunteer and provide meals for free.Tip: Always carry some back-up snacks, such as dried fruits or nuts, with you so you can eat as you get hungry.\n3. Protect your skin with sunscreen or petroleum jelly. Keep a bottle of sunscreen or petroleum jelly in your bag so you have access to it whenever you need it. Apply it to your exposed skin and rub it in until it\u2019s clear so it can absorb fully. After 2 hours, put on another layer so you stay protected from the sun.Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin from drying out due to the cold, dry air.\n4. Rest at the camps set up along the route. Look for tents and huts along the route where you\u2019re able to rest for the night during your trip. Pay for tent rental and take time to relax so you don\u2019t feel too exhausted when you reach the shrine. Make sure your clothes aren\u2019t wet before you fall asleep so you don\u2019t get cold at night.If you\u2019re shivering, slurring speech, experiencing blurry vision, or feeling nauseous, you may be experiencing altitude sickness. Rest as soon as possible and avoid climbing any higher.\n5. Pray to Shiva at the ice lingam when you reach the holy shrine. When you reach the Amarnath Temple, take off your shoes and enter the cave to see the ice lingam, which is a tall column of ice that\u2019s considered holy. Say a prayer to Shiva while you\u2019re next to the lingam before exiting the shrine.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":676}

{"conversations":["I am nervous when speaking to a group of people. How can I improve my public speaking skills?","Here are some suggestions to improve your public speaking skills.\n\nThe first thing you must do is to accept that it's normal to be nervous. Even the most seasoned public speakers still get nervous before giving a big presentation. The difference is that they have learned to control their nervousness and even use it to their advantage.\n\nSecond, you need to realize that people aren't actually out to judge and criticize you. They actually want you to be good. They want to be entertained, informed, enlightened - whatever the goal of your speech is, they want you to achieve it. When you give a speech, you and the audience have the same goal - for you to be good. So don't think that people are out to get you.\n\nThird, what you must do is to practice, practice, practice. There is no substitute for this. When you first start out, you'll be nervous even when giving a speech in front of just one other person. That's fine. Just keep practicing and you'll get better.\n\nLast, you need to learn the art of storytelling. This is a powerful technique that will help you engage your audience and keep them interested in what you have to say. Stories are powerful because everyone likes to hear stories. Even if your speech has nothing to do with stories, you can still use storytelling techniques to make it more interesting. For example, you can start your speech by telling a brief story about something relevant to your speech. Or you can use stories as illustrations or examples when explaining points in your speech."],"source":"authors","idx":476}
{"conversations":["How to prepare a paper presentation?","A paper is bad enough, but presentations are even more nerve-wracking. You've got the writing down, but how do you turn it into a dynamic, informative, enjoyable presentation? Why, here's how!\n\n## Guidelines and audience\n\n1. Know the requirements. Each presentation for each class is going to be a bit different. Some instructors will be happy with 3 minutes while others will demand you stand there awkwardly for 7. Have all the guidelines clear when you go to write your presentation. Know how long the speech must be. Know how many points you're required to cover. Know if you must include sources or visuals.\n2. Know your audience. If you're giving a presentation to your classmates, you probably have a rough idea of their knowledge on the topic. But for virtually every other circumstance, you may be in the dark. Either way, cater your paper to make zero assumptions. If you're presenting to people you know, it'll be easy to know what to break down and what to gloss over. But if you're presenting to unknown stockholders or faculty, for instance, you need to know about them and their knowledge levels, too. You may have to break your paper down into its most basic concepts. Find out what you can about their backgrounds.\n3. Know your resources. If you are giving a presentation in a facility you've never visited before, it's best to inquire about what you'll have at your disposal and what you'll need to set up beforehand. Does the facility have a computer and projector screen? Is there a working WiFi connection? Is there a microphone? A podium? Is there someone who can assist you in working the equipment before your presentation?\n\n\n## Script and visuals\n\n1. Create a script for your presentation. Although you could write everything out, it's best to use notes to jog your memory -- you'll sound more like you're talking and be able to make more eye contact. Only have one point per notecard -- that way you won't end up searching the notecard for your information. And don't forget to number the cards in case you get mixed up! And the points on your cards shouldn't match your paper; instead of regurgitating information, discuss why the key points of your paper are important or the different points of view on this topic within the field.\n2. Decide on a limited number of ideas you want your audience to comprehend and remember. To do this, find the most important points in your paper. These are the ones you should be drilling home. The rest of your presentation should be extras not necessarily addressed in your work -- if they've already read the paper, they don't need to be lectured on it. They're there to learn more. Make an outline of the highlights to help you prepare your presentation. As you form the outline, you'll see what aspects of your paper pop out the most and what order they would best be relayed in. As you go through this outline, remove any jargon if it may not be understood.\n3. Design visual aids to make your presentation even better. To help your audience follow along (and for the visual learners), use slides with graphics, charts, and bullet points to make everything a bit more captivating. It can enhance the information in your paper, yes, but it also keeps everyone from wiggling around in their seats. If you have any statistics at all, turn them into graphs. The contrasts will seem more stark when put in pictures before your audience -- numbers are sometimes meaningless. Instead of thinking about 25% and 75%, they'll be thinking about the 50% difference they see before them. If you won't have access to the proper technology, print visual aids on poster board or foam-core board. Presentation software (Powerpoint, etc.) can also double as notecards. Instead of messing with small pieces of paper, you can just click a button to get your next prompt. If using presentation software, use words sparingly, but enough to get your point across. Think in phrases (and pictures! ), not sentences. Acronyms and abbreviations are okay on the screen, but when you talk, address them fully. And remember to use large fonts -- not everyone's vision is fantastic.\n4. Think in terms of conversation. Just because this is paper-based does not mean your delivery should be equivalent to what an 8.5 x 11 can do. You have personality and are a human engaging with an audience. Use their humanness to do things you might not otherwise do in a paper. It's okay to be a bit repetitive. Emphasizing important ideas will enhance comprehension and recall. When you've gone full circle, cycle back to a previous point to lead your audience to the right conclusion. Minimize the unnecessary details (the procedure you had to go through, etc.) when highlighting the main ideas you want to relay. You don't want to overload your audience with fluff, forcing them to miss the important stuff. Show enthusiasm! A very boring topic can be made interesting if there is passion behind it.\n\n\n## Practice, practice, and more practice\n\n1. Practice your presentation in front of friends and family members. Don't be shy -- ask for constructive criticism. This helps you know whether or not you're meeting the time requirements and if not, how you could tweak your style. And once you've recited it 20 times before breakfast, your nervous should be at a minimum. If you can grab a friend who you think has a similar knowledge level to your audience, all the better. They'll help you see what points are foggier to minds with less expertise on the topic.\n2. Tape record yourself. Alright, so this one is a little much, but if you're really nervous, you may find listening to yourself beneficial. You can see which parts you're nervous about and which parts you have nailed down. It'll help you to see the flow, too, when you listen back. It'll also help you with volume. Some people get rather timid when in the spotlight. You may not be aware that you're not loud enough!\n3. Be warm. You are allowed to be a person, not just a machine that relays facts. Welcome in your audience and take a few seconds to establish a comfortable atmosphere. Do the same with your conclusion. Thank everyone for their time and open the floor for any questions, if allowed.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":711}

{"conversations":["Especially in blitz or bullet games, it is possible that a player makes an illegal move, for example castles through check. \n\n* If the opponent does notice the illegal move, then as far as I know the first player is obliged to make a legal move with the same piece, if one exists. What if there are no legal moves? \n* What if the opponent, being in time pressure, doesn't notice the illegal move and makes a move. What happens after they realize that? Does the person who made the illegal move forfeit? Or is the whole game cancelled?\n\nAre there any standard rules for these kinds of situations?","This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":98}

{"conversations":["How to cascade routers?","A good way to expand your wired or wireless network is to cascade routers. A router cascade means that 2 or more routers are connected to each other through an Ethernet cable. There are 2 ways to cascade routers: connect an Ethernet port on the second router to an Ethernet port on the first, or connect the Internet port on the second router to an Ethernet port on the first.\n\n## Connect ethernet to ethernet (lan to lan)\n\n1. Designate which routers will be the primary and which will be secondary. Your primary modem is the router with a direct connection to the internet or modem. Your secondary router will be connected to the internet through the primary router. Generally, you should use the most current router as your primary router.\n2. Plug your secondary router in. Connect an AC adapter to your secondary router, and plug it into an electrical outlet near a computer you can use to set up the secondary router.\n3. Connect your computer directly to your secondary router. Use an Ethernet cable to plug into one of the numbered Ethernet ports on the back of the router and to an Ethernet port on your computer. Make sure it is not plugged into your primary router.\n4. Access your router's web-based configuration menu. Connect to the secondary router's IP address with a web browser. Depending on the make of your router, you may have to navigate to a specific URL to access your router's web-based configuration menu. Consult your router's user manual or manufacturer's website to find out what the IP address for your router is. 192.168.1.1 is one of the most common router IP addresses. You may need to log in to the router's configuration menu. \"Admin\" is the most common username and\/or password. Consult the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn more about how to log in to your router's configuration page.\n5. Change the secondary router's IP address. Look for this option under local IP settings. The key here is to make sure that your secondary router has a different final digit than the IP address of your primary router. An example IP for your primary router is 192.168.1.1. So an example of your secondary router's IP address could be 192.168.1.2.\n6. Turn off the secondary router's DHCP Server settings. The configuration menu is different for each router make and model. This can often be found under \"Setup\", \"Advanced Settings\", \"Network Settings\", ect. Read \"How to Configure a Router to Use DHCP\" to learn more about how to locate the router's DHCP settings.\n7. Make sure your secondary router is set to router operating mode. This is often located in an advanced settings menu.\n8. Connect the secondary router to the primary router. Use an Ethernet cable to plug into any one of the numbered Ethernet ports on the primary router. Then Plug the other end of that cable into a numbered Ethernet port on the back of the secondary router. Your routers are now cascaded.\n\n\n## Connect ethernet to internet (lan to wan)\n\n1. Plug in your secondary router. Use the AC adapter that came with your router to plug it into an electrical outlet near a computer you can use to setup your secondary router.\n2. Connect your computer to your secondary router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to one of the numbered ports on your secondary router. Connect the other end to an Ethernet port on your computer.\n3. Access the web-based configuration menu. Enter the secondary router's IP address into a web browser to access the router's IP address. 192.168.1.1 is one of the most common router IP addresses.

{"conversations":["How to handle feeling out of place at work?","Many people spend a large percentage of their lives at work. This can feel terrible if you are one of many people who feel detached and disengaged within the culture of their workplace. Workplace loneliness can impact your performance and engagement, so overcoming the feeling of not belonging is central to your success. Knowing how to connect with people at work is also an important professional skill that can help your career. Manage the feeling of being out of place at work by trying to figure out what caused it, making an effort to interact, and finding solutions for disengagement.\n\n## Address the feel\n\n1. Try to label what you're feeling. Ask yourself what is keeping you from belonging. Co-workers sometimes hang out with their own age group by default and maybe you're much older or younger. Perhaps you are a manager and feel excluded from your subordinates?Maybe everyone else has energy for the job, but you're dealing with burnout. There even may be varying levels of lifestyles, values, or interests separating you and your colleagues. Sit down with paper and a pen and try to list whatever reasons come to mind. After you make a tentative list, you can spend a few days observing yourself and your peers at work to see if your reasons are accurate.\n2. Change your internal dialogue. Sometimes, the biggest roadblock keeping you from connecting with people is in your own head. If you keep telling yourself you don't fit in, you won't. Your thought patterns can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which what you believe about yourself becomes true. If you're thinking you don't belong, you're awkward, or people won't like you, reframe your self-talk. Create a list of positive, realistic statements about your workplace connections, such as \u201cI have much to offer as a friend\u201d or \u201cI enjoy the culture of my workplace, so I am certain to find people with common interests.\u201d\n3. Consider any constructive criticism you have received. If your boss or a peer has recently expressed concern that you are not a team player, dominate conversations, or bring a toxic competitive vibe to the workplace, you may need to dial it back to feel like a part of the group. If you shrugged off their feedback without trying to make positive change, they may be excluding you on purpose. If this describes your circumstances, you have two options: you can stay the way you are and remain excluded or reflect on their feedback and find ways to improve. It's up to you, just know that if you choose to stay the same, you could be hurting your reputation and growth within your career.\n4. Get help. Your engagement at your job has a major influence on your career growth and life satisfaction. If you can't seem to identify what's keeping you from fitting in, you made need to seek out professional assistance. If you are struggling with self-esteem issues or social anxiety, you should see a mental health expert. If you are dissatisfied with your choice of work or feel like your workplace does not align with your values, it may help to see a career counselor. Look into leadership or self-help workshops to get help with specific areas of personal development. One good option for leadership and self-improvement training is called Landmark Education.\n\n\n## Attempt to interact\n\n1. Set a daily conversation quota. Not belonging doesn't feel good, so even if you don't make any major changes, it can still make you feel better to interact more often. Make a personal goal to have one or two conversations with a peer at work each day. Think of some conversation starters to make it easier. Increase your chances of conversing by hanging out with your co-workers more. If they eat in the break room, don't take your lunch at your desk or work-station. Join them. Then, listen to their discussion and participate when you have something of value to add. For example, your co-workers are discussing vacation plans and one of them mentions a trip to a specific location. If you have an interest in that place, you might say, \u201cThat sounds so exciting! What sorts of excursions are you planning during your visit?\u201d\n2. Focus on the other person, not on your own shyness. If you are shy or hesitant about chatting it up with your co-workers, follow this rule-of-thumb: don't dwell on how shy you feel, turn your attention completely to the other person. Act as if you are serving them in a way\u2014try to make them smile or laugh, get them talking about their own life. When you're worried about how you're coming off to others, you might over-analyze and end up ruining a perfectly decent interaction. Take a break from focusing on yourself and devote your attention to the other speaker. Make sure to ask open-ended questions to keep the other person talking. These are questions that invite elaboration and that don't have a simple yes or no answer. Be willing to share about yourself as well to keep the conversation going and to form a genuine connection.\n3. Don't turn down invitations. If you're notorious for responding with \u201cno\u201d each time your peers invite you to lunch or to after-work drinks, they'll quickly stop asking. No one wants to be rejected over and over again, so you may have inadvertently caused them to exclude you. When you catch them discussing plans, ask if you can tag along. Or, if someone directly invites you, try to say \u201cyes\u201d unless you absolutely cannot go. Practicing saying yes to invites can improve your work life and your personal life. Accept a set amount of invitations per week and invite people to do things as well.\n4. Ask a co-worker out for coffee or similar. If the group as a whole makes you self-conscious, target one particularly non-intimidating, friendly co-worker. Making just one social connection at work can help you feel less isolated. Plus, once this person gets to know you, they might encourage the others to do the same. Say something like, \u201cHey, Carla, I enjoyed our talk earlier. It's refreshing to talk to another newbie mom. Would you like to get coffee together one morning before work?\u201d\n5. Suggest to your boss the idea of workplace socials. If your workplace culture doesn't emphasize inclusion, you might not be the only one feeling left out. Make a recommendation to your superior to stimulate connectedness with group events. Plan a potluck lunch or dinner to celebrate a company victory. Start a baseball, cricket, soccer, netball or basketball team.\n6. Seek advice about purposeful exclusion. Maybe your co-workers seem to have a vendetta against you, overlooking you for social outings and never including you in workplace gift exchanges. If this is the case, you will have to carefully consider how you choose to move forward. The best thing to do is to talk with someone you trust at your workplace about what has been happening. It can also help to first share your worries with a trusted friend. You might say, \"I get the sense that I am the odd one out at work. They never include me. And they stop talking whenever I come around. What should I do?\" Even if you don't take your friend's advice, it can help to have some unbiased support.\n\n\n## Deal with disengagement\n\n1. Resist acting out to get attention. Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too.\n2. Set an objective workplace goal. Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you can't strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards. This could be just what you need to feel passionate about your work and reconnect with the group. For example, you might aim to get so many reports done by 5pm each day. Or, you might develop a track to move towards a promotion or transfer to a new company. Try to focus on what you can control and avoid trying to control things that are outside of your control.\n3. Reevaluate the job. If the work you do and the people you do it with leave you feeling lackluster, you could be in the wrong career. If you have to change the way you act, undermine your values, or fantasize about leaving your job each day, pay attention to these cues. The culture of your workplace is just as important to your satisfaction as the actual position and salary. It may be time to quit. Re-examine why you got onto this career path or took this job.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":660}
{"conversations":["What are the general tactics of Krav Maga as opposed to Systema? \nFor instance, the tactics of Silat are to hurt the other person so badly they can't hurt back. Another example would be that the tactics of boxing would be to knock out the other person first using only punches. So, as far as I know, the goal of Systema and Krav Maga are both to do anything you can to defeat your attacker because they are serious about self defense. Does that mean that Krav Maga and Systema are strategical identical? Does Krav use strategies that Systema doesn't? Does Systema use any strategies that Krav doesn't? Is there a difference or do they generally work the same way?","At first glance Krav Maga and Systema seem to be very similar in that they are both very unconventional, no-rules, practical self-defence, martial arts (although Krav isn't technically a martial art) which are no holds barred and generally formless.\n\nHowever...\nKrav Maga is basically a very raw, dangerous situation survival system (including avoidance and escape) which builds upon your natural instincts and taught in a very short space of time.  Therefore it is highly stress tested.  It relies on the fact that fear will set in in order to use your natural responses and turn them into functional movements to your advantage. It relies heavily on shock and awe in that defence and attack should be simultaneous where possible to capitalise on the opponent's shock value.\n\nSystema is - in many ways - the exact opposite, it is a system which teaches over a much longer period of time how to control your fear\/anger\/pity and teaches relaxation (through breathing\/stretching) in stressful situations so that attacks on your person are less effective, better recovered from and the pressure points, levers and momentum of attackers can be manipulated to your advantage using the clarity of mind gained from your training.\n\nIn Summary\nSo in effect Krav Maga is taught fast and turns your weaknesses into strengths so your defence\/attack becomes like a reflex just when you need it, while Systema is a methodology that needs to be learned and seeks to remove those weaknesses so that your defense\/attacks can be more effective.\n\nAlso, another martial art, similar and somewhere between these is the Keysi Fighting Method (KFM) - developed for street fighting - but that has some actual forms that have to be learned such as the very distinctive 'Pensador' that the Christian Bale Batman uses\/\n\nKFM is a lot more like Krav Maga but it makes heavy use of the 'Pensador' guard (much like the 'Rhino' Krav pose) and concentrates a much larger chunk of its time to dealing with multiple opponents and ground based fighting, as it was developed for street fighting and this is where they tend to end up. It doesn't deal with survival (avoidance and get away) as much as Krav however. There are also no weapons."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":249}
{"conversations":["How to core apples?","Instead of buying pre-sliced apples, take advantage of whole ones while they are fresh. Whether you're baking apples or slicing one up for a snack, removing the inedible core isn't as hard as it looks. Use a paring knife or an apple corer to keep apples whole. For apples you need to cut first, scoop the core out with a melon baller. If you're looking for a quick way to prepare apples for cooking, peel them and slice off useable parts. Then, enjoy cleaned apples as is or use them as a component in another recipe.\n\n## Core whole apples with a knife\n\n1. Set the apple on a cutting board with the stem side up. Keep the cutting board on a flat, stable surface. Make sure it can't slide around while you're coring the apple. Since you're going to be using a knife, it's easy to slip and nick your fingers if you're not careful. Try putting something underneath the cutting board to help hold it in place. A damp towel or paper towel works well in a pinch when dealing with wobbly cutting boards. There are also non-stick cutting board mats you can get online and at kitchen supply stores.\n2. Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple. While holding the apple steady, push the knife into it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from its stem. You are aiming for the spot where the core ends. Cutting any closer to the stem could puncture the core and leave you with more of a mess to clean up later. If you don't have a paring knife handy, another thin blade will do. Choose the thinnest one you have in order to limit damage to the apple's flesh while you go after the core.\n3. Push the blade all the way through the apple. Hold the knife steady as you push it straight down so it doesn't cut into the core. Watch out for the sharp tip of the knife coming through the bottom's end! Tip the apple over on its side for a moment so you are able to see where the knife emerges. Coring is easiest with a knife that is longer than the apple. That way, you can remove the entire core in one go. If you don't have a knife like that, stick with a paring knife and scrape away any parts of the core left behind after the initial cut.\n4. Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple. Hold the apple steady and carefully cut in a circle without slicing into the core. Keep the blade \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the stem the entire time. This can be a little tricky to do at first, but it becomes much easier with practice. It leaves the core loose inside the apple, making it easy to remove by hand. If you're having trouble keeping the cut consistent all the way around the stem, try making more incisions. Place the knife on another side of the stem and push it all the way through the bottom again. Do this 4 times on all sides of the stem, then cut in a circle to connect the incisions.\n5. Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs. Raise the knife slowly so you don't lose control of it. Set it aside, then give the stem a good, hard push. The core will pop out through the bottom of the apple. If it is stuck, cut around the core again to separate it from the rest of the apple. Another option is to use the tip of the knife to pry the core up toward you. Once you are able to get a firm grip on it, pull it up to remove it. Knife control is important when doing this, so raise it with patience rather than yanking it toward you.\n6. Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining. Sometimes these parts break off the core and get left behind. Put the knife back in the hole and scrape around the outside edge. Push the inedible bits out through the holes in the apple to throw them away. Once you're sure you got all of the black seeds and stringy bits of the core, you're ready to cook the apple.You could also use a melon baller to scoop out the insides. Twist the melon baller around to clear out the cut, leaving it clean and consistent.\n\n\n## Use an apple corer\n\n1. Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up. Set it up on something stable and damage-resistant like a cutting board. Coring tools are pretty sharp, so don't sacrifice your countertop for the sake of an apple core. Make sure you have plenty of room to hold the apple steady while coring it. Test the cutting board or surface by attempting to move or shake it. If it seems unsteady, expect it to move at the worst time. Try putting a wet towel or a non-slip mat underneath a cutting board to steady it.\n2. Place the apple corer on the center of the apple. If you have a tube-shaped corer, position it so the apple's stem is in the middle of the tube. Push the corer down until it begins cutting into the apple. If you have a combination corer and peeler, position it \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the core with the serrated edge facing inward. Push the tip down into the apple to begin separating its flesh from the core. The easiest type of corer to use is one with a long handle and a circular tube with a serrated bottom edge. The tube fits over the core, holding it together while you pull it out. When using the vegetable peeler type of corer, you have to twist the blade around in a circle to cut out the core. The motion is the same as when using a tube-shaped corer, but it takes a little more work to rotate the corer by hand. You could also use a flat, ring-shaped corer. This type slices up the apple while removing the core. It's great for cutting an apple into wedges with one fell swoop.\n3. Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple. This takes a little bit of force, so keep a firm grip on both the apple and the handle of the corer. Rotate the corer back and forth while pushing down on it. As long as you keep the apple still, the corer will go straight down toward the opposite end of the core. If you're using the blade-type corer, push it down into the apple and begin rotating it around the core. It will separate the core from the rest of the apple.\n4. Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds. What happens next depends on what kind of corer you have. With many tube-shaped corers, all you have to do is pull the handle back to take the core out with it. For blade-like corers, lift the blade out and then push the core out with your fingers. Check the inside of the apple for leftover seeds. Corers are better at cleaning out an apple than knives, but a loose seed or core fragment can fall out of the tool and get left behind.\n\n\n## Scoop the core out of a halve apple\n\n1. Set the apple on a stable cutting surface. Use a cutting board to prevent your countertop from getting damaged. Start by standing the apple up on the board with the stem face up. Make sure the cutting board can't move at all while you're working. Stabilize the cutting board by placing a towel or mat underneath it if needed.\n2. Cut the apple in half to expose the core. Use a sharp knife to split the apple. Hold it steady and cut vertically through it to the bottom. Try to slice through the center in a single, clean motion. You will end up going straight through the core, but that is okay. If you wish to quarter the apple, you could turn the halves over onto their cut sides. Slice them top to bottom down the middle. Whether you do this before or after removing the core doesn't make much of a difference.\n3. Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller. Keep the apple halves flat against the cutting board with the skin side down. This will give you a clear view of the seeds and the fibrous sheaths in the center of each slice. They are pretty easy to remove by digging into the apple's flesh right where it meets the hard, stringy core. Clean out both halves to leave the juicy part of the apple intact. If you quartered the apples, an alternative way to remove the core is by cutting underneath it. Use a paring knife to cut diagonally down to the center point underneath the core. Turn the apple slice around and cut from the other side to cleanly lift away the core.\n4. Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife. Keep the apple halves skin side down on the cutting board. The stem and bud are on the ends of each half, right above the removed center. Hold your knife parallel to these parts and cut diagonally down underneath them. Slice diagonally down from the opposite side to complete the cut and remove the inedible parts. There are pieces of the stem and bud on both halves, so remember to get them all. You will need to make a total of 4 cuts on each half, 2 apiece for each stem and bud. Another way to do this is by scooping out the stem and bud with a melon baller or spoon. It is less precise than cutting, so it takes away more of the juicy flesh.\n\n\n## Separate the core from a peel apple\n\n1. Peel the apple using a paring knife or vegetable peeler. If you have a good vegetable peeler handy, use it for an easy way to remove the apple's skin. Drag it from the top of the apple to the bottom to remove a layer of skin. After setting aside the peel, rotate the apple and use the peeler again and again to expose the juicy flesh.If you're using a knife, slip the tip of the blade underneath the skin. Peel from side to side across the apple, moving slowly to keep the blade as close to the skin as possible. Although using a knife gets easier with practice, you could slip and cut into the good part of the apple if you're not careful.\n2. Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up. Stand the apple on a safe, stable cutting board. Make sure the board won't slide out of place while you attempt to cut the apple. As long as the board is secure, cutting the stem out is a quick and safe process.For your own safety and the sake of the apple, slip a damp towel or non-stick mat underneath a cutting board to prevent it from moving while you work.\n3. Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem. Pick up a sharp chef's knife and position it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem. Hold onto the apple with your other hand to stop it from moving. When you're ready, slice straight down, all the way to the bottom of the apple. This will separate part of the apple, leaving the core untouched and standing on your cutting board.Cut as close to the stem as you can to save the edible portions of the apple. If you cut too close to the stem, you might end up taking out some of the core. Cut the hard, stringy core chunks off the apple slices before using them.\n4. Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core. Rotate the apple so an uncut side faces you. Cut across it again and then all the way down to the bottom. Keep the knife \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem at all times so all the cut parts are even. When you're done, you will have 4 apple chunks that are clean and easy to slice up into whatever size you need.For example, lay the portions flat on the cutting board and cut them from top to bottom to create slices. Cut the slices from side to side to create smaller apple chunks.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":715}
{"conversations":["How to save money when traveling with kids?","Traveling with kids can be a fun and exciting for the whole family. It can also be expensive, especially if you want to travel overseas or across the country. Between transportation, accommodations, and excursions, you may worry how you will be able to afford to travel with kids and ensure everyone has a good time. To save money when travelling with kids, focus on cheaper transportation options and affordable accommodations. You can also plan excursions and activities that will be affordable and fun for all.\n\n## Choose cheaper transportation options\n\n1. Drive rather than fly. To save money on transportation costs, consider planning an old fashioned road trip with the kids. The price of gas will likely be cheaper than paying for multiple plane tickets, especially if you have a large family. Try to travel with at least two people who can drive so you can drive in shifts, especially if the drive will be long. To keep the peace in the backseat while on the road trip, make sure you bring lots of snacks and games for the kids. Keep them occupied with music and singalongs in the car. This way, you can all travel in peace, cheaply.\n2. Use points to book cheaper flights. If you do want to fly to your destination as a family, be sure to use any points or reward miles that you have accumulated to book your plane tickets. Set up a rewards system for air travel through your credit card or through a rewards card for a specific airline. Always check to see if you can use points to reduce the cost of plane tickets or to get better deals on flights. You should also do your research on possible flight options so you can find the cheapest one. Compare flight prices online. Watch for flight deals and book them right away so you get a more affordable price.\n3. Consider taking the train. If train travel is an option, look into train prices to see if it will be affordable. You can often buy rail passes that you can use for many days at a time and there is usually cheaper family pricing. Train travel may be a good option if you are planning to travel across the country, such as within Europe or within a specific area in the U.S. Some train passes also cover admission to certain attractions and excursions in the area you are travelling to. This may be a good option if you want to also save money on attractions for the whole family during your trip.\n4. Take public transit as a family. Public transit, such as buses, light rail, and trams, are ideal if you want to save money when traveling with kids. Get a public transit pass as a family and use it to get around, especially if you are traveling to major cities or destinations. Often, public transit can be a great way to interact with the locals and see different areas from the comfort of your seat. Most public transit passes can be purchased by day or for multiple days. They are often $10 or less, depending on where you are travelling.\n\n\n## Select affordable accommodations\n\n1. Travel during the off-season or shoulder-season. Travelling during the off-season can make your travel expenses more affordable, especially transportation and accommodation costs. Going on your trip during the off-season, usually the fall months, will make hotels and other accommodations cheaper than during peak season. Consider booking your trip during the off-season or during shoulder-season, the time between peak and off-peak. For example, if you\u2019re planning a trip to Walt Disney World, the shoulder-season is May and September, where crowds are thinner and accommodations are more affordable.\n2. Book a home share or a rental property. Finding cheap accommodations when you have kids can be a challenge, especially if you want a space larger than a hotel room. Consider renting a house through online rental property sites. Often, a home rental will have an affordable nightly rate or week by week rate. Having a home rental will also help you to also save money by cooking your own meals and not having to pay for parking, if the home rental has a parking spot already. A home share, where you share a home with other people or another family, can also be an affordable option. You may travel with family and friends and share a large home rental together to cut down on costs.\n3. Use hotel points to book a hotel. If you decide to stay in a hotel while travelling, use hotel points to make it more affordable. Collect points over time through your credit card or another rewards card and use the points to reduce your hotel rates. Try to book a hotel during off-season or shoulder-season so you get a more affordable rate. Sometimes booking a hotel during the week instead of the weekend can be a cheaper option. You can also try looking online for deals on hotels and book it before you leave on your trip. Often rates are cheaper online and booking in advance may save you money.\n4. Go for a family travel package that includes accommodations. If you are traveling to a destination that is known to be popular with kids and families, such as Disneyland, look for travel packages. Travel packages often include airfare and accommodations at a reduced rate. This could be a good way for you to save money and not have to worry about booking your own accommodations, as it is included in the package. If you are travelling to a tropical destination, such as Mexico, you may look into travel packages where you stay at a family friendly resort. Resort packages often include airfare and accommodations.\n5. See if you can stay with friends or family. To really save money on accommodations, see if you can all stay with friends or family who live near your destination. You may plan a trip to see friends or family members who have larger homes where you can all stay together. Or you may set up a blow up mattress that you can then use when staying with family or friends to make your accommodations very cheap.\n\n\n## Plan affordable excursions and activities\n\n1. Book excursions in advance to save money. Do your research and make a list of excursions you want to go to with the kids. Then, book these excursions in advance, if possible. Often, booking excursions in advance can get you a cheaper rate. It will also put less stress on you to figure out things to do once you arrive at your destination. You should also check for family pricing when booking excursions. Often, booking excursions as a group or a family can make them cheaper.\n2. Find free, fun activities for the kids. Excursions can be expensive, even with family pricing. To save money, look for free, fun activities for your kids. Research activities online in the area you are staying in, focusing on those that are free or very cheap. Come up with a fun, free activity for the kids to do while you are traveling. For example, you may book a free tour of the city you are staying in for you and the kids. Or you may take the kids to a play area at the resort you are staying in for free activities. You can also bring books and games from home with you on the trip so the kids have things to do while in the car or in the hotel.\n3. Bring snacks and light meals on excursions. To save money during excursions and activities, make sure you pack snacks and light meals. This way, if your kids get hungry, you have snacks on hand and can avoid eating out all the time. Buy snacks in bulk when you get to your destination. Prepare a few light meals that travel well and bring them when you are out for the day with the kids. For example, healthy snacks like nuts, sliced fruit, and granola bars are all good options. Light meals like sandwiches, mini yogurts, and sliced vegetables are also good for travel.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":704}
{"conversations":["I did my training around the Seattle area, and was told that landing at SeaTac Airport (the region's major International\/Commercial airport), while not strictly forbidden, was definitely frowned upon because it can slow down and interfere with the big planes on schedules. To discourage GA aircraft from using the big airport, they have a variety of landing fees, ramp fees, and prior-approval requirements.\nBut later, I moved near MCI, and was told that landing at the big airport was no big deal.  That they're actually happy to have little planes there.\nIf you fly small GA planes, do you land at the major airports in your area?\nWhat advanced preparations can you make to minimize your impact on the \"big boys\", and remain a good airspace citizen?","Can you? Absolutely, and air traffic control will treat you (almost) like any other airplane. You are supposedly handled on a first-come-first-serve basis (reality is slightly different with different aircraft speeds, etc.). Do the airlines like it if you slow them down?  No, but it's part of the system and the way that it works.\n\nVery often, there are multiple runways at bigger airports, and sometimes there are even shorter runways that are dedicated for airplanes that don't need to land on the same one as the \"big boys\". Even if not, they will work you in.\n\nNow, that being said, very often there is a better option. As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money and save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out. An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. \n\nAs far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports other than the fact that ATC is much busier. They don't have the time\/tolerance to keep repeating instructions to you, and expect you to be \"on your game\". When they rattle off taxi instructions like \"Cessna N1234, taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Tango, Echo, and Xray. Hold short of runway 23.\" they expect a quick readback and for you to follow instructions exactly because they need to move on to the next guy. \n\nIt will also help everyone out if you don't fly your final approach the way that most people are taught for an entire 10 mile final: very close to your actual landing speed. In fact, you are usually landing on a runway that is 4X+ the distance that you need and you can slow down fairly quickly (especially compared to a jet), so if you can fly an extra 20 (or 80) knots as long as possible, it will be greatly appreciated and keep traffic moving. Make sure that you leave yourself enough time to slow down at the end and above all else, ***be safe***."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":221}

{"conversations":["Are the players on the same team as the DM?","The GM isn't on a team, they\u2019re the referee.\nThe way Pathfinder, D&D, and similar games work is that there are one or more player characters (the \"party\") that are controlled by the players.\nThe GM (DM, in D&D) usually doesn't run a player character (PC), but they are responsible for representing all aspects of the world, all the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters and stuff, and adjudicating the rules.\nSo the GM may be controlling a character or creature that is friendly to the PCs, or a character or creature that is hostile to the PCs, or both at once!  The GM is the orcs you fight and the friendly cleric that heals you and the rain that falls on you.\n\nGMs aren't supposed to be hostile to you in general; they are generally taught to give the players a fun challenge. It's no good to be \"against\" the players, because you can always kill PCs just by saying \"rocks fall, everyone dies!\"  The GM is on your team inasmuch as they want everyone to have fun. Because their role is running monsters and the other stuff that you fight, they are often in opposition to you tactically, as they are responsible for the \"other team\" as part of their job.  Some new GMs do get confused by this and decide it's them against the party, but that ends up being a problem that has to be solved by them wising up or their players leaving.   \n\nThe context of your question isn't clear, so I'll add a note that might be relevant - some GMs, especially new ones, do run a PC of their own that's part of the party, these are referred to as GMPCs (or DMPCs).

{"conversations":["Assistant, I need your help. My manager is overworking me. Help me IM them something so that they get off my back.","These situations are best resolved in face-to-face conversations, which allow for more holistic and direct communication.

{"conversations":["How to fuel a race car?","Most race cars do not carry enough fuel to complete a race from start to finish. They must return to the pit area for more fuel, which is commonly called a pit stop. During the pit stop, pit crew members quickly put new tires on the car while fueling to the car to finish the race. Use these tips to learn how to fuel a race car.\n\n## Check the car refuel port\n\n1. Check the operation of the door on the refueling port before the car leaves the pit to enter the race. Make sure that the refueling door opens smoothly and closes firmly.\n2. Make sure that the fuel feed pipe is unobstructed. Examine the opening of the fuel feed pipe for obstructions. Clear any obstructions from the fuel feed pipe.\n3. Clean the opening of the fuel feed pipe. Wipe it with a clean, dry cloth. This will prevent any foreign substances from being swept down into the fuel feed pipe as the fuel is put into the pipe.\n4. Confirm that fuel is available for refueling. Make sure that 2 fuel delivery canisters of appropriate size and type for the race car are filled with the type of fuel required by the race car.\n5. Prepare and secure the fuel delivery canisters. Make sure that the 2 filled fuel delivery canisters are ready in the garage near the pit area. Ensure that the fuel delivery canisters are secured in baskets or by tie down straps so that the canisters can not be accidentally knocked over.\n6. Outfit 2 pit crew members with fire protective clothing. One of the pit crew members will fuel the car, while the other will carry the second fuel delivery canister and an approved fuel overflow catch pan.\n\n\n## Perform the refuel\n\n1. Get into position for the approaching pit stop. Have 1 crew member pick up the first fuel delivery canister. Have a second crew member pick up the second fuel delivery canister and the fuel overflow catch pan.\n2. Attach the first fuel refilling canister. As the race car comes to a stop in the pit, open the door on the refueling port. Insert the nozzle of the first fuel delivery canister into the fuel feed pipe and invert the fuel delivery canister to allow the fuel to flow out. Hold the fuel delivery canister at about a 60-degree angle.\n3. Catch overflow fuel from the first fuel canister. The crew member with the fuel overflow catch pan must set down the fuel delivery canister that was carried out, and place the fuel overflow catch pan to catch fuel overflows.\n4. Attach the second refueling canister. When the first fuel delivery canister is empty, pull it out of the fuel feed pipe and set it down away from the race car.

{"conversations":["How to cope with being unloved by your parents?","Parents are supposed to love, guide and protect their children. They are supposed to help them grow and develop as independent people. Unfortunately, some parents mistreat, abuse, neglect, or abandon their children instead. Feeling like your parents don't love you hurts emotionally and sometimes physically.  The best way to get past it is to accept that you cannot change other people and focus on yourself.\n\n## Develop cop mechanisms\n\n1. Talk to a trustworthy friend or family member. Sometimes just talking to someone about what you are dealing with can make you feel better. Try talking to a trustworthy friend or family member about what has been happening in your home life. For example, you could try talking with a close friend about the way that your parents make you feel. Choose someone you feel comfortable talking to and who you know will not turn around and repeat what you said to your parents. Try to avoid becoming too dependent on this person for your emotional needs. Just talk when you need someone to listen to you. If you find yourself calling several times a day for reassurance, then you may be developing a codependent relationship with this person. Talk to your school counselor or therapist if you find yourself depending more and more on other people for validation.\n2. Find a mentor. Mentors can guide you through important life decisions and teach you things that your parents are not willing or able to teach you. You can find a mentor to help you learn new skills for navigating difficult situations, succeeding in school, or advancing your professional career. Try asking a trustworthy, responsible adult in your life to mentor you, such as a coach, a teacher, or a boss. If your coach or boss offers to mentor you, make sure that you take him or her up on that offer; however, you can also try asking someone to mentor you, such as by saying, \u201cI admire your success in life and I hope to achieve many of the same things you have someday. I am not sure how to get there. Would you be willing to mentor me?\u201d\n\t* Try to avoid becoming too dependent on your mentor. Keep in mind that a mentor cannot replace your parents you should not look to this person for parental guidance. A mentor is just someone who can help you reach your goals in school, work, or in another specific area of your life.\n3. Seek help from a therapist or school counselor. Learning to cope with your parents\u2019 behavior can be difficult, so you may need to seek help from a therapist or school counselor. A therapist or your school counselor can help you to develop coping mechanisms and begin to feel better about yourself. If your school has a counselor, stop by and see if you can make an appointment to talk. If you feel uncomfortable doing this or you're not sure how to go about it, talk to a teacher you trust. You may also try asking your counselor if you can see a therapist by saying something like, \u201cI have been struggling with some things lately, and I would like to see a therapist to talk about them. Can you help me find one?\u201d\n\t* Keep in mind that if your parents are abusing you, then your therapist or school counselor will be required to report it.\n4. Resist comparing how they treat you and your siblings. If your parents seem to favor a sibling over you, it doesn\u2019t mean they love one of you any more or less. There could be a situational reason why they treat your sibling with more thoughtfulness or effort. Most of the time it is also unintentional, and your parents may not even realize they are treating you differently. Most aren\u2019t trying to make you feel unloved but aren\u2019t aware of how their actions affect kids mentally and emotionally. Try not to focus on how your parents treat your siblings. Instead, just focus on your relationship with them\n5. Try not to take it personally. It can be hard to dismiss criticism and hurtful language from people who are supposed to love you, even if you know that what they are saying isn\u2019t true. Remember that your parents\u2019 behavior and words is about them and not about you. The next time one of your parents says something mean or does something to hurt you, try telling yourself, \u201cI am a good person who is lovable, beautiful and worthy. My parents are just struggling with personal issues and that is why they said\/did that.\u201d\n6. Be kind to yourself. Some children who are mistreated by their parents treat themselves badly as well, such as by cutting, using alcohol or drugs, or intentionally failing at school. Performing these unhealthy, harmful activities will not make you feel better in the long run. Instead of doing these things, make sure that you nurture yourself, such as by:\n\t* \n\t* Maintaining a healthy diet. Exercising moderately most days of the week. Starting a daily meditation practice. Not smoking and not using drugs or alcohol.\n7. Replace negative self-talk with self-love. People who grow up in unloving households may be more prone to negative self-talk and have low self-esteem. To train your mind to think positive things about yourself, replace the negative thoughts with positive ones. For example, if you hear yourself repeating something your parents said like \u201cYou\u2019re stupid if you can\u2019t figure out division problems,\u201d you might replace it with: \u201cLearning long division is challenging, but I can succeed by working hard at it. I can also ask my math teacher for help.\"\n8. Write yourself a positivity cheat sheet. It may help you to examine any negative thoughts that are interfering with your ability to love yourself and write some positive thoughts to replace them. To get started, make a chart with four columns. In the first column, make a list of your negative beliefs. These might include things like, \u201cI am not good at making decisions,\u201d or, \u201cI am not very smart.\u201d\n\t* In the second, explain why you believe these things. Did your parents tell you these things or do things to cause you to feel this way? In the third column, think about what believing this is costing you emotionally and in your personal life: are you depressed, withdrawn, afraid to try new things and fail, afraid to trust others or let people in, etc.? List briefly but specifically what you are missing out on by letting yourself continue believing this negative self-image. Then for the final column, rewrite the thought to make it positive. For example, you might change a thought about your intelligence to something like, \u201cI am an intelligent, capable person and I have accomplished many things using my brain.\u201d\n9. Get out of the house more. Developing a happy, full life outside of your home will help you to feel happier even if your home life is not happy. Finding valuable ways that you can contribute to the world while being an active part of your community can help you rebuild your self-worth and confidence by focusing your attention on your well-being and happiness. Try volunteering for a local non-profit organization, getting a job that you will enjoy, or joining a youth organization or sports team.\n\n\n## Stay healthy and safe\n\n1. Report any physical or sexual abuse. If you are being abused, then seek help right away. Talk to a teacher, your doctor, a counselor, or call the police or children\u2019s services and ask for help. Chronic abuse gets harder to recover from the longer it goes on. Don\u2019t allow abusive people, even family, to cause you permanent physical or emotional damage. Get away from them as soon as possible. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-SAFE to talk about your situation and options. Don't hesitate to dial 911 if you think you or another family member is in immediate danger. You aren\u2019t going to get in trouble for reporting that someone else is breaking the law!\n2. Sever your relationship, if possible. If you are able to break ties with your abusive parent, do so. It is hard to give up on anyone you care about, especially family, but your primary responsibility is to take care of yourself. Don\u2019t feel guilty for severing contact with your parent(s) if you feel it\u2019s the best thing for you. If you are not sure cutting off all contact is necessary, consider the amount of pain they cause you vs. the amount of happiness. Dysfunctional parents may show love sometimes, typically when it serves their own interests, but a little love now and then isn\u2019t enough to justify staying in a bad relationship with anyone.\n3. Resist the urge to isolate yourself from peers and other adults. You might think avoiding relationships altogether will prevent you from getting hurt any more or by anyone else, but human beings need social relationships to thrive. Children who grow up without a loving parent or an alternative parental figure are less successful, less happy, and physically sicker as adults. Keep talking to your friends and other family members regularly, go spend time with them whenever possible, and be open to meeting new friends and trustworthy adults. Not every adult or loved one will end up treating you like your parent does. Don\u2019t be afraid to give others a chance to love you. Long-term loneliness can have serious health effects, worsening or even maybe causing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. It may even cause cancer to spread faster.\n4. Learn how to be independent. If your dysfunctional parents aren\u2019t teaching you how to make it on your own after high school, ask another adult you trust how to prepare for the \"real world.\" Learn this like how to create a budget, how to do laundry, how to turn on the water heater in your first apartment. Estimate the costs of independent living and what you will need to get started. Get a job and save up money for a security deposit on your first apartment and some furniture. Maintain good grades despite trouble at home so you have the option of going to college. Ask your school counselor to help you find scholarships to pay for it.\n\n\n## Recognize toxic parent\n\n1. Consider how your parents respond to your accomplishments. One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, \u201cSo what? It\u2019s just a test.\u201d\n2. Think about any controlling behaviors that your parents use. It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college.\n3. Note a lack of emotional connection. Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things. For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying.\n4. Consider the boundaries between you and your parents. Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same. For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends.\n5. Reflect on any verbal abuse you have suffered. Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse. For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, \u201cYou\u2019re worthless!\u201d or, \u201cI can\u2019t stand to be in the same room with you!\u201d\n\t* Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you.\n6. Identify narcissistic behaviors. Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic. For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child\u2019s welfare.\n7. Think about any parenting roles you played. Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and\/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead.\n8. Judge their behavior over what they say. Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don\u2019t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren\u2019t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says \u201cI love you,\u201d but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":773}
{"conversations":["In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?","There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins. That article has links to all the original scientific papers referred to, so you can check the validity yourself."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":322}

{"conversations":["We can define cross products mathematically like if we take two vectors, we can find another vector with certain properties but why do we use it in physics, if we consider a hypothetical physical quantity like force which is equal to cross product of certain vectors?\n\n  For example, the force exerted on a charge in motion in an uniform magnetic field.\n\nWhy is it so? Why does that force have to be a cross product of two vectors?\nIs it possible to come up with them when what we do is just observe the nature?","This is a great question. The dot and cross products seem very mysterious when they are first introduced to a new student. For example, why does the scalar (dot) product have a cosine in it and the vector (cross) product have a sine, rather than vice versa? And why do these same two very non-obvious ways of \"multiplying\" vectors together arise in so many different contexts?\n\nThe fundamental answer (which unfortunately may not be very accessible if you're a new student) is that there are only two algebraically independent tensors that are invariant under arbitrary rotations in $n$ dimensions (we say that they are \"$\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ invariant\"). These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$. Contracting two vectors with these symbols yields the dot and cross products, respectively (the latter only works in three dimensions). Since the laws of physics appear to be isotropic (i.e. rotationally invariant), it makes sense that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic as well. The dot and cross products turn out to be the only two possible multilinear options.\n\nWhy multilinear maps are so useful in physics is an even deeper and more fundamental question, but which answers to that question are satisfying is probably inherently a matter of opinion."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":230}

Variable assignments  and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The  return status is the exit status of list.\n  { list; } list  is simply executed in the current shell environment. list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.  The return  status  is the exit status of list.  Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is  permitted  to  be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the shell syntax is quite consistent and the subshell participates also in the other ```()``` constructs like command substitution (also with the old-style ````..```` syntax) or process substitution, so the following won't exit from the current shell either:\n```echo $(exit)\ncat <(exit)\n```\n\nWhile it may be obvious that subshells are involved when commands are placed explicitly inside ```()```, the less visible fact is that they are also spawned in these other structures:\n\n* command started in the background\n```exit &\n```\ndoesn't exit the current shell because (after ```man bash```)\n\n  If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.

{"conversations":["How to be cool in college?","Congratulations, you\u2019re in college! If you feel anxious at all about college life, know that you are not alone. To gain instant respect from your fellow classmates and friends, remember to always be yourself. Being friendly and acting confidently are also ways you can earn some cool points among your friends and classmates.\n\n## Reinvent yourself in college\n\n1. List the things you want to change about yourself. Grab a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. List the things that you would like to change about yourself in the left column. In the right column write down why you would like to change these things. If after asking why you see that making these changes leads to a better you, then change it. For example, wanting to be less critical of others, or more focused in class are positive changes.\n2. Try something new. College is all about exploring new things and ideas, so be adventurous. When you get the invite to go eat at an exotic restaurant, take it. Studying abroad for one year is another great way to expand your horizons. Try changing your hair color, or style your hair differently. You could also learn a new language, or take a class outside of your major.\n3. Remember to be yourself. It is possible to re-invent yourself without changing your true self. Don't throw out your morals and values just to be considered cool. If the change takes too much effort or requires you to be someone else, then it probably isn't a good change. Stick to changes that produce positive results. If you want to be more outgoing, then be more outgoing on your own terms. Don't start drinking or smoking just to be more outgoing, for example.\n\n\n## Boost your confidence\n\n1. Make a list of your strengths. Also make a list of the things that you like about yourself. Tape the list to your bedroom wall or bathroom mirror. Every morning, read the list to remind yourself of how great you are.\n2. Reverse negative thoughts. If you find yourself thinking that you aren't good enough for college or that no one will want to be friends with you, then reverse these thoughts. Instead, tell yourself, \"I am good enough for college,\" or \"Many people would love to be friends with me because I am a great friend.\"\n3. Do the things that make you feel confident. If wearing makeup helps you feel more confident, then wear makeup. If smiling and greeting your classmates makes you feel more confident, then greet them. If joining a club or volunteering helps you feel more confident, then join a club or volunteer. By doing the things that help you feel more confident, you will be more confident.\n4. Realize that you are not alone. New people and places can make you feel alone and unsure at times. However, understand that you aren't the only one who feels this way. Try to reach out and befriend other classmates, or call your high school friends if you need someone to talk to. If you cannot seem to shake your loneliness, make an appointment with a counselor on campus. A counselor can help you work through hard times.\n\n\n## Be social\n\n1. Portray a friendly attitude. Smile and say hi to your classmates sitting next you. Strike up a conversation by asking them what their major is or what they think about the class. Offering help, like showing someone where the admissions office is, is also a great way to become known as a friendly, down-to-earth person in college. You could also offer to trade notes with someone, or help someone study for a big test.\n2. Be accepting those who are different from you. A typical college has at least 20,000 students, (smaller colleges and community colleges might have anywhere from 2,000-10,000 students) so you are bound to run into someone whose background is completely different from yours. Instead of shying away from them, be curious about who they are. Invite them to lunch or a party to get to know them better.\n3. Attend a football game (or any other sporting event). Tailgating with friends and attending a football game (or any other sporting event) afterward is a college pastime you won\u2019t want to pass up. Go to as many of these as you can, especially if you enjoy them. It is a great way to connect with new people and cultivate friendships. Ask a classmate if they would like to go to a game, or make plans with your roommate to attend a game.\n4. Join a club on campus. If football games or Greek life isn\u2019t your thing, try looking into different clubs on campus. Like sororities and fraternities, they typically host events in the beginning of the year to recruit new members. Attend some of these and join your favorite ones. There are so many clubs in college, the hardest part will be picking one. You can also start a club as well.\n5. Host a party. Hosting a party will definitely shoot you up to the top of the cool list. Have a potluck, plan an outdoor party at a nearby park, or reserve a party room at your college\u2019s game center. Invite your friends, roommates, and acquaintances from class. You could also have a small party in your dorm room, if it is allowed. To ensure your party\u2019s success, make sure to provide some snacks and beverages, cool tunes, and games.\n\n\n## Dress for college\n\n1. Put yourself together before class. Before going to class, make sure to brush your teeth and comb your hair. Also shower if you need to. By taking the time to groom yourself before class, you can give your classmates and professors a good impression of yourself.\n2. Choose sneakers over heels. Going from class to class requires a lot of walking. By wearing sneakers, you can ensure that your feet will be as comfortable as possible. . Some classes will require you to wear certain footwear for practical or safety reasons, especially if you are in some hands-on classes or a PE class. Your instructor\/professor will inform you in the syllabus.\n3. Carry a jacket with you. Unlike high school, colleges usually don't have locker areas so you will be wearing or carrying a jacket during the winter season in colder climates. Classroom temperatures typically run very cold to sometimes very hot. Since it is hard to concentrate in class if you are cold, make sure to bring a jacket or a sweater with you. This way you can ensure that you will be comfortable and attentive in class.. People will be paying more attention to your outerwear as part of your look in college than in high school; so, make sure the outerwear you choose matches your preferred look.\n4. Dress with style. Arrive to class in an outfit that makes you feel comfortable, but also one that sends a message of sophistication and style. If casual athletic gear is your style, then wear that. If a cute dress or skirt makes you feel confident, then wear it.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":686}

Kotlin's coroutines look significantly less powerful and more cumbersome to use in comparison. I base my opinion on coroutines on this design talk by Andrey Breslav (JetBrains) Slideshow from the talk is accessible here.","Kotlin coroutines are different from Rx. It is hard to compare them apples-to-apples, because Kotlin coroutines are a thin language feature (with just a couple of basic concepts and a few basic functions to manipulate them), while Rx is a pretty heavy library with quite large variety of ready-to-use operators. Both are designed to address a problem of asynchronous programming, however their approach to solution is very different:\n\n* Rx comes with a particular functional style of programming that can be implemented in virtually any programming language without support from the language itself. It works well when the problem at hand easily decomposes into a sequence of standard operators and not so well otherwise.\n* Kotlin coroutines provide a language feature that let library writers implement various asynchronous programming styles, including, but not limited to functional reactive style (Rx). With Kotlin coroutines you can also write your asynchronous code in imperative style, in promise\/futures-based style, in actor-style, etc. \n\nIt is more appropriate to compare Rx with some specific libraries that are implemented based on Kotlin coroutines. \nTake kotlinx.coroutines library as one example. This library provides a set of primitives like ```async\/await``` and channels that are typically baked into other programming languages. It also has support for light-weight future-less actors. You can read more in the Guide to kotlinx.coroutines by example.\nChannels provided by ```kotlinx.coroutines``` can replace or augment Rx in certain use-cases.

{"conversations":["How does immersion passively help with learning a language?","There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive\u2014to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":77}
{"conversations":["Why did the NES not allow rotated sprites?","For each sprite displayed on a scanline, the hardware fetches two bytes from memory, and then clocks the pixels out one by one. The sprite is eight pixels wide, and each pixel is two bits, which is why it's two memory accesses per sprite per scanline. You can imagine that this arrangement just needs a couple of shift registers to clock the pixels out.\n\nNow, flipping the sprite about its vertical axis is easy: you just clock the pixels out in reverse order! Similarly, flipping the sprite about its horizontal axis is also easy: You just fetch the bitmap from memory in reverse order. Rotating by 180\u00b0 of course is the same as flipping both horizontally and vertically.\n\nBut if you wanted to rotate the sprite 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, that's much harder. That's because the hardware would need to get one pixel from each pair of bytes, which means fetching 16 bytes from memory instead of just two. There is not enough time on this slow hardware to do that. Incidentally, this is also where the maximum number of sprites per scanline limitation comes from.\n\nIt's a similar story on the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and many others: These platforms can do some simple 2D manipulations on sprites like stretching and sometimes flipping like you've seen, but never rotations."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":309}

If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don\u2019t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren\u2019t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don\u2019t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won\u2019t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds.\n3. Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board. Carefully glide the knife as close to the skin as possible to remove the skin from the flesh.Compost the plum skin or use it in smoothies.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":622}

Is there a basic set of smells that, when mixed, can yield all, or nearly all detectable smells ?","There are about 100 (Purves, 2001) to 400 (Zozulya et al., 2001) functional olfactory receptors in man. While the total tally of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, more than half of them are inactive pseudogenes. The combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000 (Purves, 2001).\nDifferent receptors are sensitive to subsets of chemicals that define a \u201ctuning curve.\u201d Depending on the particular olfactory receptor molecules they contain, some olfactory receptor neurons exhibit marked selectivity to particular chemical stimuli, whereas others are activated by a number of different odorant molecules. In addition, olfactory receptor neurons can exhibit different thresholds for a particular odorant. How these olfactory responses encode a specific odorant is a complex issue that is unlikely to be explained at the level of the primary neurons (Purves, 2001). \nSo in a way, the answer to your question is yes, as there are approximately 100 to 400 olfactory receptors.

Homemade ricotta cheese requires just a few ingredients, and the result is lighter and fresher than store-bought cheese. See Step 1 and beyond to learn how to make a batch today.\n\n## Milk-based ricotta\n\n1. Prepare the strainer. Line the fine-mesh strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth, and set it over the nonreactive bowl. Set this contraption on your work surface so to have it ready for the cheese mixture. If you don't use cheesecloth, it will be difficult to separate the cheese curds from the whey. You can substitute a double layer of paper towels or a thin cotton dishcloth in a pinch.\n2. Heat the milk, cream and salt. Place the milk, cream and salt in the saucepan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Allow it to heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. When the mixture is hot enough, turn off the heat and move the saucepan so the milk can begin to cool. It should take about 5 minutes to reach the correct temperature. Stir the mixture as it's heating to prevent it from scorching on the bottom. Use your candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to determine whether the mixture has reached the right temperature. If you don't let it cook long enough, the curds won't separate from the whey. If you overcook it, the texture will be ruined.\n3. Slowly add the vinegar. Use one hand to stir constantly while the other hand slowly pours the vinegar into the heated milk and cream mixture. The vinegar will cause the curds to coagulate and separate from the whey. You'll see solid bits forming and floating to the top of the liquid. Keep stirring until all of the vinegar has been added. The curdling agent in this case is vinegar, but some people prefer to use other substances. Try substituting 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice for a different flavor. For a more traditional touch, try using animal rennet as your coagulant. Mix 1 teaspoon of rennet with 1\/4 cup of cold water, then stir it into the milk mixture.\n4. Let the mixture sit until it's thick. Wait about 10 - 20 minutes for the coagulant to go to work and cause the curds to separate from the whey. It's ready when the curds have floated to the top to form a thick layer, leaving the liquid whey underneath.\n5. Ladle the curds into the strainer. Scoop out the thick top layer of curds and ladle them over the cheesecloth-covered strainer. Keep ladling out the curds until all that's left in the saucepan is the whey. You can discard the whey at this point.\n6. Let the ricotta drain. Wait at least an hour for the last of the whey to drain from the ricotta through the cheesecloth into the bowl. It will take about half an hour for the ricotta to fully drain. Don't attempt to stir it or push it through the cheesecloth, as this will just push the curds into the cloth. If you'd like a creamier final product, stop draining the ricotta after 5 - 10 minutes. For a drier final product, wait an hour for it to drain.\n7. Spoon the ricotta into a bowl. The finished ricotta is now ready to use in your favorite recipe. It's delicious as part of a savory dish or a dessert. Ricotta will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\n\n\n## Whey-based ricotta\n\n1. Save the whey from making cheese in a non-reactive pot. When you make homemade cheese, you'll have curds at the bottom of the pot, and you'll pour off the whey. Filter as many of the curd particles out as you can since they would otherwise form tough \"beads\" in the final ricotta. Cover the whey and let it sit for at least 12 hours at room temperature to develop sufficient acidity. Acidified whey acts as its own coagulant, making it unnecessary to add vinegar or lemon juice to separate the curds.\n2. Heat the acidified whey. Pour it into a saucepan and heat it while stirring, taking care to avoid sticking or burning. Heat until the temperature has risen to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and a white appears on the surface. Continue heating and stirring until the temperature reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Note that the foam will build up somewhat. Be careful. If it boils, it can boil over.\n3. Remove the whey from heat and wait for it to curdle. Cover it and allow it to cool undisturbed until comfortable to the touch. The curds will soon appear like clouds suspended in the whey, while the whey will be clear and yellowish green.\n4. Strain the ricotta. Do not stir up the curd. Instead, set up a receiving pot with a large strainer and a fine clean cloth on top. Ladle the curds into the cloth, leaving the whey in the saucepan. Discard the whey. Be sure to scoop out the curds gently. Because the curds are very fine and delicate, they can stop up the cloth easily. This will cause very slow draining if they are broken up.\n5. Drain the whey through the cloth. It can take 2-3 hours for the whey to completely drain. If you prefer, you can set the strainer in the refrigerator and let it drain overnight.\n6. Remove the ricotta from the cloth. Pack it into a container, cover it and store in the refrigerator. Use it soon after making. Ricotta will keep up to a week in the refrigerator. Alternatively, ricotta freezes very well.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":628}

{"conversations":["Why are prions in animal diets not destroyed by the digestive system?","Proteases are enzymes in your digestive system that help break down food, acting like molecular-sized scissors that cut up proteins.\n\nProteases have clefts, or subpockets, into which proteins fit, where the substrate (protein) gets cut.\n\nInfectious or pathogenic prions are resistant to proteases, because of their three-dimensional shape, which hides away parts of the prion that would normally fit in proteases and which would cause the prion to be digested.\n\nPrions that do not cause disease \u2014 normal prions \u2014 have a different three-dimensional shape that allow them to fit into proteases, and so they are not resistant to digestion:\n\nA wealth of evidence contends that the infectious pathogen causing the prion diseases, also referred to as spongiform encephalopathies, is solely comprised of PrPSc, the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein (21-23). Both PrPSc and its normal cellular counterpart, PrPC, are encoded by a cellular gene (2, 19). Physical and molecular characterization of PrPSc and PrPC has failed to reveal any chemical differences between the two isoforms (32). However, PrPSc acquires distinctive conformational characteristics upon its conversion from PrPC. Whereas PrPC is soluble in most detergents and can be easily digested by proteases, PrPScis insoluble in detergents and maintains a protease-resistant core, designated PrP27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid (25).\n\nDr. Neena Singh also discovered that prions &quot;piggyback&quot; or attach to another protein called ferritin, as they make their way through the digestive system:\n\nDisease-causing prions are thought to have passed into people when they ate beef from infected cattle, triggering the brain wasting condition called new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD. But researchers have not been sure exactly how prions enter the body.\nTo find out, Neena Singh and her team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, mimicked the process of eating and digesting infected meat.\nThey mashed up brain tissue that contained prions from patients who had a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They then exposed it to a range of harsh digestive enzymes from the mouth, stomach and intestine, which normally break proteins into pieces.\nPrions, which are known to be enormously tough, escape this attack almost unscathed, they showed, as does a second type of protein called ferritin, which stores iron and is abundant in meat. The two proteins seem to stick together, they report in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nThe researchers next added the digested slurry to a lab model of the human gut: a growing sheet of cells from the intestinal lining. By attaching fluorescent tags to the two proteins, they showed that they are transported through the cells hand-in-hand. &quot;Prions probably ride piggyback&quot; through the gut wall into the body, Singh says.\n\nAttaching to ferritin may provide additional protection from digestion, insofar as this removes prions from the digestive system, where proteases are concentrated."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":268}
{"conversations":["How to change a chain on a mountain bike?","No matter how cheap or expensive your bicycle is, there will come a day when you need to fix or replace its chain. The structure of a mountain bike may be more complex than the structure of a regular bike, but the chain changing process is similar. With the right tools and a little bit of patience, you'll have a new chain on your bike in no time.\n\n## Remove the chain\n\n1. Secure your bike. It's unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over. A bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well, but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on. If you don't have a rack, simply lean your bike upright against a wall.\n2. Take a picture of the chain. To make the reinstallation process easier, take a picture of the chain so you can refer to it later. Make sure your picture shows how the chain feeds through the gear mechanism.\n3. Check for a master link. A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin\/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master links are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother. The master link for a bike is specific to the chain size and brand. If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases. If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, order a chain-tool to remove the chain. They're inexpensive and essential pieces of equipment.\n4. Position your chain. This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between the crankset and the rear wheel will be easiest. If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool.\n5. Remove the chain. Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. If you have a master link, use master-link pliers or your hands to squeeze both ends of the master link inwards so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If you're using a chain tool:\n\t* Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link. Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain. You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged. Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it.\n\n\n## Attach your new chain\n\n1. Avoid using failed chains as replacements. Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones. Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.\n2. Measure your replacement chain. It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one. Count the number of links if your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove. If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike.\n3. Insert your chain into the gear mechanism. For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at the bottom midpoint between your wheels. Positioning the ends of your chain at the bottom midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible and allow gravity to keep the chain on the bike until you can secure it.\n4. Remove extra links from the chain, if necessary. If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain. When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear.\n5. Attach the loose ends of your chain. With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link. You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place.\n6. Test your chain. Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers. Cycle the suspension by sitting on the saddle and bouncing up and down a few times to test your chain length. To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.\n\n\n## Inspect your chain for wear\n\n1. Use a chain wear indicator to evaluate your chain for best results. You can find a chain wear indicator at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading. Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values. If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn.\n2. Try to join the ends of your chain to test for wear as a simpler alternative. If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:\n\t* Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur. Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain. The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfers the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":612}

Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.\nInstead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.\nThe most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. Many people thought bottom was hit around November 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around March 2009.

{"conversations":["How to wax your armpits?","Waxing your armpits may be more painful than shaving, but it keeps your armpits hairless for 4-6 weeks. You can reduce the pain and prevent ingrown hairs from occurring by preparing your armpits and using the right kind of wax.\n\n## Get ready to wax\n\n1. Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:\n\t* Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than \u20444 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.\n2. Wrap yourself up in an old towel. The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting impregnated with wax.\n3. Powder your underarms. Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.\n4. Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1\/4 cup water and 1\/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.\n\n\n## Apply the wax\n\n1. Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.\n2. Apply a wax strip. Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place. If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip. Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.\n3. Remove the strip. Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.\n\n\n## Finish the job\n\n1. Examine your armpits in the mirror. If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.\n2. Remove excess wax with oil. Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.\n3. Clean the area. Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging. If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":799}

{"conversations":["How to backpack in the rain?","## Deal with a sudden storm\n\n1. Put on any protective gear that you\u2019ve brought. All hikers should carry lightweight rain gear or at least a poncho in case of rain. If you don\u2019t have these items, try to use what you do have, such as an extra garbage back that you carried just in case or a tarp.\n2. Keep your body moving. Even if you\u2019re trying to stay out of the rain, move around as you wait so that your body stays warmer. For example, march in place or step side to side. Hypothermia can easily set in if you get too cold, so generate as much body heat as you can.\n3. Seek shelter. Look around you for a place to duck out of the rain, such as a tree canopy, a cave, a cabin, or even your tent. If you plan on camping and have a waterproof tent, you may find that settling in early and riding out the storm is the best solution. If you hear thunder, seek immediate shelter. Staying outside during a thunder storm is dangerous.\n4. Watch for changes in the terrain. Rain can cause flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and slippery trails, all of which can be very dangerous. Look for signs such as flowing water, rising tide lines, shifting soil, and a sheen on the surface of the trail. When in doubt, walk away from the questionable terrain.\n5. Stay away from open fields, elevated areas, and water. If you\u2019re caught in a lightning storm, the most dangerous places to be include open areas, hills, mountains, trees, cliffs, and waterways. Lightning is most likely to strike these areas, so avoid them. If you\u2019re in the woods, try to find a small grove of trees that are surrounded by other taller trees. Tuck yourself in the lowest spot you can find. If you are stuck in an open area, look for the lowest spot, crouch down, and keep most of your body from touching the ground. Ideally, just the soles of your feet will make contact with the ground. If you have access to a vehicle, stay inside of it but try not to touch the sides of the car.\n6. Put down your trekking poles or other long objects. In a lightning storm, trekking poles and long, pointy objects make a great conductor for the lightning and are therefore very dangerous. Protect yourself by laying these items on the ground away from you.\n7. Pay attention to changing weather. Check the forecast before and during your trek, and watch for signs of a coming storm. If winds pick up and the sky becomes overcast, consider changing your route so that you can reach safety before the storm hits. It\u2019s better to cut your trek short and have the storm pass over rather than get caught in dangerous weather.\n\n\n## Plan a trek in a rainy environment\n\n1. Choose the right insulation for rainy weather. If you wear natural insulators like down or clothing made from cotton, the water seeps into the fabric and takes away the warmth. These fabrics can pull the heat from your body. Wool, fleece, and synthetics stay warm even in a downpour, so they are a better option if you know the weather will be rainy.\n2. Dress in layers. Stay warm by wearing long sleeved wool, polyester, or microfiber clothing under your rain gear. If the weather will also be cooler, add multiple layers. Your clothes will likely still get wet under your rain gear, but fabrics like wool and fleece can remain warm. On the other hand, you may want to look for items that dry easily, such as polyester. Choose items that will feel comfortable and flexible under your heavy raincoat. Avoid cotton, which will hold the water and drain your heat.\n3. Wear a hard shell raincoat and rain pants. A hard shell raincoat will hold up better than a soft shell raincoat in a sustained storm. You can protect your legs with rain pants or vented pants, depending on the temperature of the area and your preference as a hiker. Vented pants will be less insulating but dry quickly. Rain pants can help keep in your warmth and repel water, but they will eventually succumb to the onslaught of water.\n4. Choose the right shoes. For shorter backpacking trips, waterproof boots and gaiters are your best bet, while longer trips are best accomplished with breathable trail runners. If you\u2019re in the rain for long periods of time, your feet are going to get wet no matter what shoe you wear. Trail runners are easier on your feet and dry quicker than other options.\n5. Wear a hat. Your weakest link in staying warm is your head. Even with a hood, heat will escape from your head. Keep your head warm by wearing a hat. If you choose a hat that has a brim, you can also keep some of the rain off your face.\n6. Use a waterproof bag or use a pack cover. While they\u2019re expensive, waterproof bags far outrank pack covers in keeping your gear dry. A pack cover can easily be compromised by a wayward branch, which can pull off the cover. Additionally, water can still seep into the unprotected back of the bag. While a waterproof pack is preferable, a pack cover is better than nothing. Line the inside of your bag with a heavy-duty garbage bag.\n7. Protect your gear inside plastic bags. Protect items that need to stay dry, such as food, electronics, your map, your light source, etc. into plastic Ziplock bags, heavy-duty trash bags, or dry bags made for backpackers. If you are carrying a sleeping bag, tent, or other related items, make sure they are protected as well.\n8. Pack a set of dry clothes. If you\u2019re camping, make sure that you have a set of dry clothes to sleep in so that you can change out of your wet gear overnight. Not only will you be more comfortable, but it will help you keep your body temperature regulated. Store your dry clothes in plastic with your other dry gear.\n\n\n## Stay safe on rainy trail\n\n1. Choose a good trail. If you know that the weather will be rainy, choose an area that you can enjoy in the rain, such as a trek through the forest. Consider visibility and safety, since waterways can flood and rocks can become slippery. When in doubt, plan to keep your hiking short and bed down early.\n2. Avoid opening your pack. Each time you open your pack water drips in. Even if it\u2019s only a small amount of water, it can quickly compromise your pack. The water will remain in your waterproofed pack for the entire trek, so don\u2019t risk lugging around the unnecessary weight. Store frequently needed items and your snacks in pockets or in dry bags attached to the outside of your pack.\n3. Make sure that your map stays dry. If you don\u2019t have a waterproof map, then make sure that your map never gets wet. Ideally, it should be secured in a plastic see-through bag. Try not to remove it when it\u2019s exposed to rain.\n4. Snack often. Regularly munching on snacks will help you keep your body warmer, which is important when you\u2019re getting wet. Rain can cause hypothermia if you get too cool, so plan to eat more often than on a dry hike.\n5. Apply oils to your feet. The wetness from your socks can rub away your natural skin oils, which is what causes blisters. Applying a light salve to your feet can help prevent this from happening. Carry a salve and smooth it onto your feet when you settle in for the night.\n6. Stay hydrated. When it\u2019s raining, some hikers forget to drink their water. Even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty, make sure that you\u2019re sipping on your water to keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can quickly become an issue.\n7. Take short breaks. Rainy weather makes breaks less desirable because it allows your body to cool down, causing you to be cold and uncomfortable. You also have the incentive to keep going until you reach your destination and can get out of the rain. However, not taking breaks can easily tire you out. Stay energized by taking shorter breaks than you normally would but more often. For example, if you would normally take a 15-minute break after hiking for an hour and a half, take a five-minute break every 30 minutes.\n8. Avoid placing wet gear in your tent. When you do stop to camp, keep your wet items separate from your dry items. Carrying wet gear into your tent can easily lead to everything being wet. Instead, cover up your gear and leave it outside the tent.\n9. Give your feet a chance to dry. When you stop to camp or to take an extended break, take off your shoes so that your feet have a chance to dry out. If you have dry socks, put them on. Otherwise, leave your feet bare. This will help keep your skin healthy and avoid blisters.\n10. Watch for the signs of hypothermia. Rain can lead to hypothermia, even if it\u2019s not very cold out. Stay safe by monitoring yourself for signs of hypothermia. If you do notice any, take steps to warm yourself, such as pitching camp and changing your wet clothes for dry ones. Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, tiredness, cool or pale skin, and shallow breathing. Symptoms of moderate hypothermia include confusion, drowsiness, tiredness, shallow breathing, cold or pale skin, ceasing of shivering, and shedding clothes despite being cold.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":727}
{"conversations":["How to repair your damaged reputation at work?","People make mistakes. Sometimes these mistakes are bad enough to cost us the respect of those around us or even our jobs. If you\u2019ve made a bad professional error or hurt colleagues at work, though, the damage might not be permanent. You can put the past behind you, but you\u2019ll have to work hard to rebuild relationships, become a model worker, and, in some cases, manage your reputation online.\n\n## Rebuild relationships\n\n1. Admit your mistake. If you\u2019ve damaged your reputation \u2013 wronging a coworker, angering your boss, or just getting an overall bad name \u2013 the place to start is to own up to it. Admit the error of your ways. Take stock of your actions and accept responsibility for them, to yourself and in front of others. What happened? Where did you go wrong? Be brutally honest with yourself. For example, do you have bad personal habits? Did you try to cut corners and dodge work? Have you been an office gossip? Or, did you have a serious lapse of judgement? Perhaps you stole someone\u2019s idea and got caught or plagiarized a report. Perhaps you just stole, embezzling money.\n2. Apologize. Even if you don\u2019t have a future at your workplace, you should apologize to the people you\u2019ve hurt. Showing remorse is decent and will help you start to redeem yourself. You will not get very far with building bridges and repairing your reputation if you can\u2019t say sorry. Act as soon as you can. The longer you wait to apologize, the more it seems like you aren\u2019t really that sorry. Don\u2019t make excuses. The point is to show remorse and accept that you were wrong. Don\u2019t insert half-excuses or mealy-mouth language into your apology, for example \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were offended that I took your idea. I only wanted to improve it.\u201d\n\t* Be humble and own up. For instance, \u201cIt was really wrong of me to talk behind your back. I know I\u2019ve hurt you and want to ask for your forgiveness.\u201d\n\t* Be sincere. You won\u2019t get credit if you don\u2019t say specifically what you did. You also won\u2019t credit if you don\u2019t say it apologetically and sincerely, showing that you won't repeat the behavior.\n3. Commit to reform. Besides an apology, write out a plan for how you\u2019ll change and ensure your mistake doesn\u2019t happen again. This can be for you alone or, if you\u2019re lucky to keep your job, to share with the powers that be in the organization. Outline what you did wrong and how you will avoid it. For example, \u201cI made the mistake of getting too involved in workplace gossip and ended up saying harmful things about my coworkers. From now on, I plan to keep my head down, mind my own business, and avoid office politics.\u201d\n\t* Don\u2019t forget to \u201cwalk the walk\u201d and follow your plan. You might arrange regular check-ins with your boss, for instance, to discuss your behavior. This will highlight your progress as well as show that you are willing and able to reform.\n4. Keep your attitude in check. Repairing your reputation is going to be a humbling experience. You might feel angry or resentful. You might get annoyed, frustrated, or upset. Keep these emotions under control \u2013 you\u2019ve had a bad attitude in the past and need others to see that you\u2019re trying to change. Try to stay calm, collected, and positive. Be aware of the attitudes or emotions that added to your bad behavior in the past. Try to avoid them or situations that bring them out. If your problem is gossip, avoid the office gossipers as best you can. Stop and ask yourself throughout the day, \u201cHow\u2019s my attitude? Am I positive? Am I productive?\u201d Catch any problems early and try to readjust your mindset.\n\n\n## Become a model employee\n\n1. Get to work early. Apart from apologies and repairing relationships, set yourself up as a model employee to help you rebuild your work reputation. Be a go-getter. Arrive early and ready to impress. People will eventually start to notice. Getting to work early will make a good impression on your boss and perhaps your coworkers. Often, people aren\u2019t around to see who leaves the office last. But they will notice your presence in the morning. Being early also means you don\u2019t have to rush around. Use the quiet time to your advantage and plan out your day. It doesn\u2019t hurt to take a short walk around the office first thing in the morning. People will see you and take note.\n2. Prioritize. Some people have trouble keeping track of what they need to do during a given day or week. Take initiative and prioritize your work. Keep your nose to the grindstone to avoid returning to past mistakes and to present yourself as great employee. For instance, sit down and write out what you need to do for each day or, longer term, each week and month. If you\u2019ve been coming to work early, use that time to set out daily priorities. Having a to-do list will help you focus your energy. You might also tailor the list to take advantage of your peak work hours. For instance, if you do your best work in the morning, save that time for your top priorities. Try to stick to the list. That said, be flexible in case your boss gives you special instructions.\n3. Do your tasks thoroughly and on-time. Writing down your tasks isn\u2019t all, of course. You actually need to follow through and do them well. Good work and dependability can make a past mistake fade over time. Build up a track record for reliability and your colleagues and boss will have more trust in you in the future. Meet your deadlines. What about that report that\u2019s due next week? Prioritize it in your list on Monday. If you still can\u2019t get it done during the week, consider finishing it at home or over the weekend rather than asking for more time. Be productive, especially if you have had consistency problems before. Take a short breather to stretch or use the restroom, but don\u2019t try to skirt work.\n4. Go above and beyond. Handing in finished work on time is good. To be a model employee, though, you will have to aim even higher and win (or win back) your boss\u2019 trust. Track details, anticipate tasks, and work ahead to further develop a good reputation. If a colleague asks you to think of venues for an upcoming tradeshow, for example, don\u2019t just stop at a list. Take the next steps: call them, ask about availability, and compare prices. When you take initiative like this, you\u2019ll seem smart and like the logical go-to person for key projects.\n\n\n## Repair your reputation online\n\n1. Check your online metrics. If your error was very serious, or if you are well-known and hold a big position, you might want to think about your online presence when rebuilding your reputation. Don\u2019t underestimate negative online info. To start, you will need to take stock of the situation. You can get a quick sense of your online reputation by checking Google\u2019s autocomplete. Just go to the Google homepage. What appears when you type in your name, or your company name? When you enter your name, for example, do you get something positive or neutral like \u201cHarold Bing Brew Co. CEO\u201d and \u201cHarold Bing business award\u201d? Or is it damaging, like \u201cHarold Bing mugshot\u201d? Look at online news stories or reviews about you or your company, if applicable. Check local sites or other social media. Set up a Google Alert in your name, so that you\u2019ll be notified any time something new is posted.\n2. Deal with Google defamation. Programs like Google Suggest reflect real internet searches and should give you an idea of how people associate your name and reputation online. Did you find something unwelcome in your results? There are some things you can do. Do not try to manipulate the results. While some people suggest this approach, using techniques like crowdsourcing, you might end up causing more damage. You might try acquiring the search term and building an optimized page to tell your viewpoint. That way, when someone types \u201cJuliette Page embezzler\u201d she is directed to your side of the story \u2013 that the charge is false, misunderstood, or not reported right. You can also request that the search engine take down the autocomplete. This is hard and usually only works with results that suggest hate or violence, porn, or personal information. Still, it may be worthwhile to try.\n3. Hire an online reputation manager. Your online reputation could get out of control. Don\u2019t despair, however. There are people and agencies who can help you manage this kind of situation, like Reputation.com or BrandYourself.com. The work will be pricy, but it may just salvage your working reputation. Reputation managers won\u2019t always be able to get rid of negative content from the web. But they should be able to highlight positives about you. For example, their services might include setting up a domain in your name for a page presenting your side of the story. They can also respond to negative comments or reviews and manage your online presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube. The goal is not to eliminate all negative info about you, but to tip the balance in your favor whenever someone searches for you online. Keep in mind that management services don\u2019t come cheap. Expect to pay between $20 to $200 per month.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":743}
{"conversations":["In monopoly, can an opponent put a property up for auction at a higher price than I have in cash?","This is definitely allowed, and a good tactic to leverage a cash advantage.\nThere is no minimum or maximum price for an auction.  The rules state:\n\nBidding may start at any price.\n\nMonopoly auctions do not have &quot;the bidding will start at $10&quot;.  They just have &quot;bidding is open&quot;.  Once the auction begins, a bid by any player sets the minimum price for the auction at that bid.  Your opponent could easily bid $10 on the property, forcing you to either let them have it for $10 or bid more than you have in cash.  You could bid first, say starting the bid at $5, but that doesn't meaningfully change the situation, as they can just respond by out-bidding you at $10.\n\nYou may bid more money than you have in cash, but you are still obligated to pay it if you win the auction.  This may be a reasonable play if you can afford it by mortgaging property and\/or selling houses, especially to drive up the price for your opponent.  But be careful not to bid  more than you can pay after mortgages and sales, as if you win the auction and can't pay your bid, you go bankrupt.  In particular, if you bid more than you can afford, you opponents can all just let you win the bid, at which point you go bankrupt and the property you just bought would go up for auction again (in addition to all your other properties)."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":379}
{"conversations":["The Episode IV-VI movies never mention the Emperor's name. In Episodes I-III, we can guess that Darth Sidious will be the emperor, but what about Chancellor Palpatine? If the audience didn't know that he was Sidious, the impact of the reveal would be far different than if they did.\nBut I did. In all the novels and comics that came out after \"Return of the Jedi\", the Emperor's name was stated plainly: Palpatine. \nSo when I saw the prologue movies, for the life of me I couldn't figure out: was I supposed to know that Palpatine was the villain?  \nMaybe the filmmakers figured that most of the moviegoing public never got into the Expanded Universe. But they had to know that the hardcore fans would know. Or maybe when you watched the movie, even if you hadn't heard of Palpatine, it was supposed to be obvious?\nWhat was the intent?","Palpatine's name was first given in the prologue to Alan Dean Foster's novelization of Star Wars (it was credited to Lucas, but he didn't write it), which came out in November 1976, six months before the May 25, 1977 release of the actual film.\nSo Palpatine being the Emperor was literally known before the public ever saw a Star Wars movie. It was, in fact, one of the very first things people could find out about the Star Wars universe.\nThe point of the films wasn't to conceal the fact Palpatine would end up the Emperor (or was Darth Sidious), it was to show that he was a masterful chessmaster who conned everyone, and that in large part it was the good guys responsible for his rise because of their own blindness. Amidala initiated the vote that removed his predecessor. Jar-Jar initiated the vote that gave him emergency powers. The Jedi Council allowed him to operate under their noses. Anakin never suspected he was being manipulated until too late, and so on. Just as the trilogy was meant as a tragedy showing Anakin Skywalker's rise and fall, it was an additional tragedy in that the person responsible for the whole mess was standing right there the entire time, in the case of the celebration at the end of The Phantom Menace quite literally."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":49}

Intentionally leave out a few missing positive and negative numbers, but include 0 at the center.\n* Ask students to identify the missing numbers on the number line and write down on a sheet of paper.\n* Ask one or two students to come up to the board to write the missing numbers.\n* Select a point on the number line and ask a student to come up and show the opposite of that number on the line.\n\n###Teacher Instruction (10 minutes):\n* Show that opposites are the same distance from zero, but in different directions. Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value. Students should notice that absolute value is always positive.\n* Tell students that absolute value is also helpful for understanding real-world situations. Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6\u00b0C, 1\u00b0C, and -3\u00b0C on the board.

{"conversations":["How to do a simple number mind trick?","Amaze your friends and relatives with these number-based mind tricks. These three tricks are arranged from easiest to hardest (smallest numbers to biggest). Even young kids can do the simple number prediction trick.\n\n## Simple number prediction\n\n1. Set the trick up. Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.\n2. Write down your prediction. Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together. Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n4. Tell him to divide the larger number by the smaller one. He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the\\ smaller one. Give him some time to work this out. 222 \/ 6 = 37,\n5. Announce that his number is 37. As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":724}

{"conversations":["How to speak english?","English is a language which is spoken all around the world, and learning to speak it can help you meet new people and advance your career. Learning to speak English can be hard, but with practice and patience, you can become fluent in your new language.\n\n## Get the basics down\n\n1. Start simple. Very few people are true beginners when it comes to English. \"Hello,\" \"hi,\" \"How are you?\" and numerals have infiltrated most societies. Odds are you know more English than you think. Take what you know. For example, \"How are you?\" That uses the verb \"to be.\" What are other questions just like this? Take what you know and expand it! How is she?How is your father?How are your children?How is the weather? Start memorizing verbs. The top ten most common verbs in English are the following: \"be,\" \"have,\" \"do,\" \"say,\" \"get,\" \"make,\" \"go,\" \"know,\" \"take,\" and \"see.\" Just knowing these verbs can get you through a lot of basic conversations. English is subject-verb-object, in that order. Your subject pronouns are: \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he\"\/\"she\"\/\"it,\" \"we,\" \"you,\" \"they.\" Object pronouns in English are: \"me,\" \"you,\" \"him\"\/\"her\"\/\"it,\" \"us,\" \"you,\" \"them.\" With those verbs and knowing English is SVO, what sentences can you come up with? I know her.She makes it.He takes us.\n2. Practice conversations. Once you have basic subject and object pronouns down and a handful of verbs, you can start asking questions. Questions often open with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" and \"how.\" \"Who\" indicates a person; \"what\" indicates a thing; \"when\" indicates a time; \"where\" indicates a place; \"why\" indicates a reason; \"how\" indicates a manner. Say you know the subjects, some basic nouns, those ten verbs, and these question starters. What are some things you could ask an English speaker? What is your name?What do you do?When is your birthday?Where is she?Why do you have it?How do you know?\n\n\n## Get familiar with the grammar\n\n1. Start with the present tenses. Let's start with present simple and present continuous:\n\t* Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple. I go to work every day.She eats breakfast at 7.China is a big country. Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is \"am\"\/\"is\"\/\"are\" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:\n\t* You are reading.I am typing.He is watching TV.\n2. Move to the past and future tenses. Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:\n\t* Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time. I saw that movie last year.She died on a plane.We went to the bank yesterday. For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too. They are making a cake tomorrow.You are leaving in May.I am going at 6 pm.\n3. Put your adjectives before nouns. Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:\n\t* There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a \"huge, round, metal bowl\" or a \"small, red sleeping bag.\"\n\n\n## Maintain progress\n\n1. Label everything. Take the objects in your house and label them with their English equivalent. The goal is to get your mind thinking in English. When it's right there, it'll be impossible to ignore. When you've labeled everything and find yourself thinking, \"Where is my blanket?\" try to think of the word (or sentence) in English. When you find your blanket, were you right? Don't write on the objects--grab a slip of paper and tape it on sturdily.\n2. Keep an eye on your pronunciation. It's very easy to get caught up in memorizing words when pronunciation can be just as important. Unfortunately, English has exceptions to most rules. But there are still some general guidelines you can abide by:\n\t* Always say the last sounds in the word. Certain Asian dialects find this rather difficult. If you know you're guilty of this, keep it in mind. \"Streets\" is not pronounced stree. The \"ts\" is very important in retaining meaning. Take the sentence \"I project the project will end soon.\" Confusing, huh? Isn't English SVO? Yes, and this sentence is too. The first \"project\" (verb) is pronounced pro-JECT; the second (noun) is pronounced PRO-ject. The same is true for all verb-noun pairs: nouns stress the first syllable, verbs the second. Though there are definite exceptions, most nouns in English have the first syllable stressed. Think of the nouns in your house: \"BED-room,\" \"BATH-room,\" \"KITCH-en,\" \"TA-ble,\" \"WIN-dow,\" \"SO-fa,\" \"WA-ter,\" \"JACK-et,\" \"TOI-let,\" etc.\n3. Pick a dialect. There are meaningful differences between American, British, and Australian English. Before you go about increasing your vocabulary, which one appeals to you? Sometimes it's very important to know who you're speaking to. If you tell an American, Canadian, or Australian you're not wearing pants, they might wonder if you're wearing shorts, a dress, a skirt, or just in your underwear. If you tell a British person you're not wearing pants, you're going commando! In addition to vocabulary differences, the pronunciation differences are huge. Know these variations exist before you get confused with multiple correct pronunciations. Certain dictionaries use British English and certain dictionaries prefer American. Choose the one that's best for you.\n\n\n## Use your resources\n\n1. Get a good dictionary. If you need to, get several. A dictionary to translate between your first language and English is best, in addition to a dictionary in English only. Get a pocket-sized version for when you're on the go and that pesky word you keep forgetting comes up.\n2. Speak in English with native speakers. Though it may be tempting to speak with your other friends who are learning too, you'll see the quickest results if you converse mainly with native speakers. Hire a tutor or private teacher. Make sure they're native and have the accent you want. Choose someone with teaching experience--just because you can speak a language does not mean you can teach it. If a teacher isn't up your alley, get a penpal!\n3. Use the internet. There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of sites you can use to your benefit. Anything to make grammar more exciting is welcome--there are games and videos galore. Such resources can be found at Simple English Wikipedia, the British Council, and English Club, among many others. YouTube doesn't have to be about funny animals and popular music. Tap into its educational resources as well.\n4. Watch TV, listen to songs, and read books. Though your goal is to speak English, you have to be able to understand it, too! Even when you're alone and not stuck in a grammar exercise you can keep your mind primed. Start with children's books and TV shows. The language is simpler and will go slower. Eventually, move to channels catered to your interests. If you enjoy cooking, graduate to the Food Network and see what you can pick up on. Try not to turn on the captions! If you have a DVR, record the shows. That way you can go back and work through the dialogue and conversations at your own pace. Listen to English music! Ballads go quite slowly and the refrains can be rather repetitive. Your vocabulary will naturally expand, too.\n5. Think in English. If you find yourself thinking something simple in you native tongue, what would its equivalent be in English? Make a habit of this for maintenance and memory. Think out loud if helps. Explain to your roommates or family what you're trying to do; maybe they'll want to catch on, too! Eventually, simple phrases will become par for the course.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":765}
{"conversations":["How to say \"my name is\" in several languages?","Here is how to say \"My name is...\" in several languages. The exact phrase is on top, with pronunciation guides in the bullets below.\n\n## European languages\n\n1. Say \"Moeto Nme e\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Bulgarian. This translates to \"my name is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* \"MO-eg-toh e-meh eh \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n2. Say \"Ik heet \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Dutch. This is a somewhat gravelly sound. While \"heet\" is pronounced like \"hate,\" natural speakers almost slur the two together, almost like \"hee-EIGHT.\" \"Ick hate\"\n3. Say \"Je m'appelle \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in French. The words will somewhat glide together. This translates as \"I am called.\" \"Jhe- ma- pelle\"\n4. Say \"Me llamo \\_\\_\\_\\_ in Spanish. This one most people already know, but they still get tripped up by the double-L. In Spanish, the double-L sounds like an English \"y.\" \"Meh Yam-oh\"\n5. Say \"ich heisse \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in German. Really differentiate the three syllables, keeping them sharp and distinct. \"Ikh High- saa\"\n6. Say \"\u039c\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (Me lene) in Greek, or use an alternate expression. For more formal hellos, you can also say, \"\u039f\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"To o-no-ma mou e-ne,\") which translates to \"I am called.\" \"Meh Leh-neh\"\n\t* You can also change things up with \"\u039b\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9,\" (\"Leh-go-meh,\") meaning \"I'm named.\"\n7. Say \"A nevem\" in Hungarian. Like in French, the words need to somewhat slur together. The \"v\" sound in the middle should sound about halfway between a V and a W.\n\t* \"A neh-wem\"\n8. Say \"\u00c9g heiti \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Icelandic. Icelandic is one of the world's hardest languages, but luckily fo you \"My Name is\" is quite easy. \"Yeg hey-tih\"\n9. Say \"mise \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Irish Gaelic. Not that this sounds completely different from how it looks. The \"se\" at the end sounds much more like \"sha.\" \"Mish-ah\"\n10. Say \"M\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442\" Russian. No, that \"3\" shape is not a typo, it's just a part of the Russian Alphabet. If you don't have time to learn the whole thing, the pronunciation isn't tough. This translates into \"I am called.\" \"Men-ya za-voot\"\n11. Say either \"mi chiamo \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"sono \\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Italian. These are the English equivalents of \"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" \"Mi Chiamo\" (Mee Key-ah-mo). \u2192 \"My name is....\"\n\t* \"Sono: (soh-no). \u2192 \"I'm...\"\n12. Say \"Nomen mihi est \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Latin. If you know how to speak Italian, Spanish, or French, the pronunciation is very similar. \"Me-he no-men es\"\n13. Say \"M\u0103 numesc \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Romanian. You can also use the phrase \"m\u0103 chiam\u0103\" as well. \"Ma new-Mesk\"\n\t* \"Ma key-ama\"\n14. Say \"Eg heiter \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Norwegian. Like in German, you're looking for three well-pronounced, distinct syllables. The second word sounds like \"height,\" as in how tall something is, in English. \"Egg Height-er\"\n\t* Note: this may also be spelled \"Jeg heter.\" This second versions is the more formal, traditional spelling. Both are correct.\n15. Say \"Vol\u00e1m sa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Slovak. For more formal, longer phrase, you can use \"Moje meno je \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\"). The words in Slovak tend to be slightly jammed together, especially here, where they might sound like one word. \"Vol-am say\"\n16. Say \"Jag heter \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Swedish. For more formal conversations, try out \"Mitt namn \u00e4r.\" This is tricky one, as the letters aren't used quite the same way in English. Try to make the \"i\" in \"mitt\" sound like an \"E\" sound. \"Yog Heat-err\"\n\t* \"Mit Nam Aer\"\n17. Say \"mia nomo estas\" (\"my name is\") or \"mi nomi\u011das\" (\"I'm called\") in Esperanto. Esperanto was invented in Poland after WWII as a politically neutral, global language. \"Mee-ah No-mo Ehs-tas\"\n\t* \"Mee no-me-jas\"\n\n\n## Asian languages\n\n1. Say, \"\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae\" (Amar nam) in Bengali. If you can't read the characters, that is okay. The phonetic sounding is not difficult to pick up. \"Am-ar Nahm\"\n2. Say \"Mer\u0101 n\u0101m \\_\\_\\_\\_ hai\" in Hindi. Note how there is a word after your name -- \"hai.\" This translates literally to \"My name Nick is.\" This is grammatically correct in Hindi. \"May-rah nahm \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ hey\"\n\t* You use the same phrase in Urdu. It is written out as \"\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \\_\\_\\_\\_ \u06c1\u06d2.\"\n3. Say \"\u79c1\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f...\u3067\u3059\u3002(Watashi no namae wa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ desu)\" to speak in Japanese. Note that there is a word \"desu\" that comes after your name in Japanese. For simpler speaking, you can say, \"I am \\_\\_\\_\\_,\" or \"Watashi wa Nick\"' desu.\" \"Wat-a-shee no na-my wah \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n\t* Wat-a-shee wah \\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n4. Use versions of \"Ako si \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Tagalog (Filipino). There are several versions of an introduction in Tagalog, all of which are easy to pick up. The word for name, \"pangalan\"\n\t* \n\t* Casual: Ako si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \" \"AkOH see\"\n\t* \n\t* Polite: Ako po si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"AkOH poh see\"\n\t* \n\t* Formal: Ang pangalan ko ak\\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"An pan-nall-en co ack\"\n5. Say \"\u6211\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u662f \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"W\u01d2 de m\u00edngz\u00ec sh\u00ec\") to say your name in Chinese. This is in the Mandarin dialect. Chinese is not just about accent but also inflection, which completely changes the meanings of words. This is one you should absolutely listen to examples of. \"Wuo - duh - meeng -- tza -- shuu \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* For a simpler translation, try \"Wuo Jiao \\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* In Cantonese Chinese, use the phrase \"Ngo kui tso.\"\n6. Say \"\u1781\u17d2\u1789\u17bb\u17c6\u1788\u17d2\u1798\u17c4\u17c7 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"khnhom chhmoh\") to speak in Khmer. Things might get difficult in Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos, but this phrase can help start introductions. \"Ka-nohm ch'moo-ah\"\n7. Say \"T\u00ean t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Vietnamese. Some speakers drop the first word, sticking instead with \" t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_.\" \"Ten Thoy la\"\n8. Say \"\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"p\u014fm ch\u00eau\") if you're a man, and \"\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"di-chen ch\u00eau\") if you're a female speaking Thai. Thai is a gendered language, so make sure you use the right form. The last word, though hyphenated below, should be smushed together. Male: \"pohm chee-ew\"\n\t* Female: \"dee-shaun chee-ew\"\n\n\n## African and middle eastern languages\n\n1. Say \"My naam is\" in Afrikaans. This language has some English roots, so it will be easier for you to pick up potentially. You'll also notice that is spelled with eerie familiarity...\n\t* \"May naahm ehs\"\n\t* Some people substitute \"Ek\" for \"my.\" This is more traditional, typically.\n2. Say \"\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0647\u0648 (Ismi houa)\" in Arabic. Some dialects of Arabic actually omit the second word, such as Sudanese Arabic. \"Is-mee Ho\n3. Say \"Ninaitwa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in Swahili. It's just one word, followed but your name. \"Nee-na-nweet-wa.\"\n4. Say \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ laa tudd\" to say your name in Wolof, a West African dialect. Note that Wolof is not a written language, so spelling is not very important. The language is common in Senegal, Gambia, and parts of North Africa. \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ la tood\"\n\t* You can also use \"Maa ngi tudd \\_\\_\\_\\_\" for \"my name is.\" Pronounced \"mahn-gee too-doo.\" Note the extra syllable on \"tudd.\"\n5. Say \"Igama lami ngu \\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Zulu. Again, this isn't a commonly written language, so don't worry much about spelling. It is pronounced much like it looks, with the \"ngu\" the hardest part. Sound it out like \"new,\" but try to get out a gutteral \"G\" sound right before the word. This is called a \"glottal stop,\" for word nerds out there. \"Ig-ah-mah la-mee (g)new\"\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":716}
{"conversations":["I heard north ridge of mount Stuart from my friends, can you tell me more?","Sure thing! This iconic North American climb is a 1200 ft (364 m) multi-pitch alpine trad route with 18 pitches, rated as Grade III. It is a famous alpine rock route, not just in Washington, but nationally. First ascended by John Rupley & Don Gordon (1956) [Great Gendarme] and James Wickwire & Fred Stanley (1964), it's a must-do for alpine rock enthusiasts.\n\nRoute Overview:\nFrom the Stuart Glacier notch, approximately 11 pitches of low\/mid 5th class climbing lead to the Gendarme's base. Despite the enjoyable exposed climbing, the Gendarme features the most remarkable pitches. Two crux 5.9 pitches await, with the first being a steep dihedral offering good rests between challenging sections. Traverse to the offwidth, power through it, and tackle one more 5.8-5.9 pitch before the final three pitches of low 5th.\n\nEquipment:\nGear preferences vary. Carry your usual equipment for long alpine rock routes. If you want extra security in the cruxy 5.9 offwidth, carry one 3.5\" piece. You may need an ice axe and crampons if you approach via the glacier. \n\nGetting there:\nDrive I-90 to exit 85, turn left to join SR-970. Drive 6.6 mi and turn left on Teanaway River Road. Follow north fork road approximately 23 mil to the end of road.\n\nApproach and Descends:\nMultiple approach options exist, each with pros and cons. Either approach from the south via Longs Pass TH or from the north via Mountaineer Creek. Acquire a topographic map to determine the best route. If approaching from LPTH, head to Ingalls Lake, traverse ledges around the lake's east side, follow the trail to Stuart Pass, and descend northwest on talus. Ascend more talus to Goat Pass, traverse Stuart Glacier, and reach the 4th class gully leading to the North Ridge's prominent notch, marking the beginning of the upper ridge. If descending via LPTH, head down from the summit towards the false summit via blocky terrain, follow cairns and a ledge system east, and descend the seemingly endless Cascadian Couloir, eventually reaching Ingalls Creek.\nScramble to the false summit. Descend steep snow or scree then keep right through sparse trees to enter the Cascadian Couloir. Descend all the way  to the valley floor, and then you can go back to via Long\u2019s peak or Ingalls Lake. \n\nThis route is incredible and a must-do for anyone at ease with alpine rock climbing at this level. Keep in mind, though, that it's quite challenging and requires serious commitment. Just make sure you're prepared and always stay safe!"],"source":"authors","idx":401}

{"conversations":["How to be happy in an unhappy marriage?","People remain in unhappy marriages for many reasons. If you're one of those people, you may feel like you can't be happy. Nonetheless, you can find your own way to happiness, even in a bad situation, by practicing habits that lead to happiness, and you may even be able to work on your marriage to move toward happiness as a couple.\n\n## Learn to be happy\n\n1. Find ways to be grateful. It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratitude can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier. Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Try writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about. For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids.\n2. Engage in flow experiences. Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general. Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but that is still familiar so that you can lose yourself in it. For example, if you enjoy painting landscapes, then you might try painting a new subject such as a portrait or a basket of fruit.\n3. Stop fighting the same fights. That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or try to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, if you tend to fight over politics, then you might want to make politics an off-limits topic. Or, if you often fight about what movie you are going to watch on Friday nights, then you might want to take turns choosing the movie.\n4. Develop your own interests. If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage. Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs or cookery classes, or taking a vocational class at a nearby community college.\n5. Try volunteering. Having a sense of purpose and some good social connections with other people is also a good way to feel happy. Volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life and it also allows you to interact with other like-minded people, it might help you to feel happier. Try to find an organization that you would like to contribute to, such as an animal shelter or a food bank, and apply to become a volunteer. You might even ask your spouse if he or she would like to volunteer with you and it might be a good bonding activity for the two of you.\n6. Develop your social life. Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness. If your main relationship is unhappy, then you may not see how you can change your situation. Your spouse doesn't have to be your main source of social interactions. You can have fulfilling relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family. Try to go out to dinner with friends one night per week or get together with a sibling or cousin for a day of shopping or a activity session such as tennis or swimming. If you don't have a lot of friends, then try to meet more people who share your interests. For example, you could join a bowling league, take an art class, or find a choir or band who need new members.\n\n\n## Work towards a better marriage\n\n1. Take time to be together. Making time for each other is a way to say you are committed to each other. Say you will spend a certain time each week with each other, and stick to it. It will also give you a chance to get to know one another again.\n2. Remember what you valued. When you first got together, you were probably partially attracted by the differences the other person exhibited. For instance, maybe you were exhilarated by the fact that he or she was impulsive and loved to be spontaneous. Now, you may find yourself hating the quality. The key is to try to remember why you loved that quality in the first place and move toward enjoying it again. For instance, it may drive you crazy when your spouse wants to drop everything and drive to the mountains. On the other hand, it keeps your life from getting too boring. Try to strike a balance, and enjoy what you can.\n3. Talk about strengths and difficulties. It is important to acknowledge what is going well in your relationship as well as what has become a struggle. You might even want to make a list of strengths and difficulties together. Make sure that you include things on the list that you avoid talking about because of fears that you will just end up fighting about them. Try to pick a time to talk about your strengths and difficulties when you are both feeling calm and focused. Avoid talking at the end of a long day or at other stressful times. Use \"I\" statements rather than \"You\" statements. In other words, try to talk about what you're feeling and what you think is wrong without blaming the other person. For instance, saying \"I get upset when we don't spend enough time together\" is better than \"You're never around.\" The second statement puts your spouse on guard, while the first helps open discussion. Spend time talking and listening. That is, you can't just lay out what you think is wrong. You also need to spend time actively listening to what your spouse has to say. Show you're engaged by offering short summaries of what he or she has said and by asking questions that are relevant to the conversation.\n4. Work out solutions. Once you've figured out together what issues you have in the marriage, it's time to try to come up with some solutions. You may even be able to draw on some of your strengths to help you develop solutions to problems in your relationships. To compromise, you must talk about your wants and needs, helping you both to decide what's most important to each of you. In other words, to make a compromise, you must be willing to let the other person win when it comes to their needs, giving ground when it comes in conflict with your wants. The same must be true of the other person.\n5. Think about counseling. Sometimes, you need the help of a professional to get past your problems. A marriage counselor may help you fix more problems than you expect, and in fact, about half of people who use marriage counselors say that the counselor helped them fix all of the major problems in their marriage.\n\n\n## Consider the alternative\n\n1. Try legal separation. A legal separation gives you the time away from your spouse that you may need to work out problems. It is different than a divorce because you remain married. The benefit of a separation is it gives you a legal way to work out custody and child support while you are living apart, as well as how your property should be divided up. Nonetheless, if you work out your problems, you can go back to a normal marriage.\n2. Know divorce may be a better option. While getting a divorce is a life upheaval, staying in an unhealthy marriage can be detrimental to self-esteem and mental health. Some studies have shown it's better to get out of a caustic relationship and work to improve your own mental health than to stay. Understand an unhappy marriage can lead to depression. One study, which involved data from 5,000 adults, showed that the quality of your most important relationship is a good predictor of developing depression. Meaning, if one of your closest relationships, including your spousal one, is in bad repair, it puts you at risk for developing depression.\n3. Consider reasons to divorce. You may find that you have a good reason for getting a divorce. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you will likely find that you are a happier person once you get out. You might consider a divorce if your spouse had an affair. While some couples overcome infidelity, others never recover from it. If you find that you can't forgive your spouse for what he or she did even after months or years, you may want to consider a divorce. You've grown in different ways. Sometimes, when you grow into full-fledged adults together, you take different directions. If you find you and your spouse can't agree on much of anything anymore because you are just too different, it may be best to divorce. Your partner is bad at finances and won't change. Of course, everyone makes bad money choices sometimes. However, if your partner is so bad that it is causing stress on your marriage or is bankrupting your family, you may need to get out of the marriage, especially if you've expressed concern but your spouse is unwilling to change. Think about the kids. Many unhappily married couples stay together for the kids. Divorce is hard on kids, but it's also true that being unhappily married can be hard on your kids, as well. Your kids know you're unhappy, and if you're constantly fighting, you're putting stress on them, anyway.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":640}

{"conversations":["Why are we building larger land-based telescopes instead of launching larger ones into space?","Because it's cheaper.\n(1) With adaptive optics you can get 0.1 arc second resolution on the ground (admittedly only on a mountain top with particularly good air flow, but still!). This eliminates one of the major advantages of space until you get above several meters mirror diameter.\n(2) Rocket fairings are the shrouds which protect payloads during the supersonic atmospherics speeds reached during launch. A 5 meter fairing is about the largest that can be flown, which limits the size of the one-piece mirrors which can be launched.  (The Dreaded Webb Telescope's mirror is in pieces which will assemble themselves in space -- a very scary and very expensive piece of design.)\n(3) Servicing a telescope on the top of Mauna Kea or in the high Chilean Andes is a difficult and expensive process. Servicing a telescope in orbit makes that look like small change.  (Cost comparable to the cost of building a new giant scope on Earth.) And in-orbit servicing can't even be done with current technology except in low earth orbit.\n(4) While high resolution is one frontier in astronomy, going deep is another, and going deep requires big mirrors.  A 30 meter mirror on Earth gathers much more light than a 5 meter mirror in space.  The giant terrestrial telescopes simply do a better job of being light buckets for spectroscopy than anything we can yet put into space.\n\nThe bottom line is that with the development of adaptive optics, space-based telescopes of currently buildable and launchable size lost their main advantage over ground-based telescopes.  And since they're 10x to 100x the cost, they are simply not worth building for many purposes.\n\nSpace based telescopes still hold a significant edge in parts of the spectrum blocked by the atmosphere such as UV and IR (Webb), and for certain tasks involving long-term high accuracy photometry (Kepler) and astrometry (Gaia).  But for general purpose use, the balance seems firmly on the ground's side for large telescopes.\n\nThis will change if space flight becomes cheaper -- the SpaceX BFR, for example, with its 9 meter fairing and dramatically lower launch costs, offers great hope for space telescopes."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":324}

{"conversations":["How to react if you see a suicidal post on facebook?","## Respond on facebook\n\n1. Comment and encourage the person to seek help. Many people ignore suicidal social media posts for various reasons. However, social media suicide threats should be considered as serious as any other suicide threat. You may want to reply back to the person or send them a private message where you encourage them to seek help. Consider sending them the numbers to a suicide hotline to talk with a trained suicide counselor. Two suicide hotline numbers you can give them are 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Suicide.org provides suicide hotlines broken down by state, and also provides international numbers. They also give numbers for Spanish speaking hotlines, and hotlines geared towards specific groups, such as LGBT youth and military veterans.\n2. Report the post. When you see a suicide status update on Facebook, you have the option to report the post. When you report the post, it alerts Facebook that the poster may need help. Facebook then sends the person a message asking them if they would like to talk to someone (like a helpline worker) or be sent some tips to help them work through the problem. Reporting the post is anonymous, so the poster won\u2019t know you reported them. To find the \u201cReport Post\u201d link, look for the arrow in the top right of the status box. When you hit the arrow, it should give you the option to \u201cReport Post.\u201d\n3. Use Facebook\u2019s \u201cReport Suicidal Content\u201d option. When you see a suicidal message on Facebook, you can report them directly to Facebook. This option is different than simple reporting the post. You find the \"report suicidal content\" page in Facebook's help section and provide information directly to Facebook. You will need to provide the person\u2019s name, the link to their profile, a link to the suicidal content, and a screenshot of the post.\n\n\n## Help the person\n\n1. Contact the person\u2019s family and friends. If you see a suicide threat but are not close enough to the person to contact them yourself, reach out to the person\u2019s family or friends. They may not be aware of the post. Let them know what you saw on Facebook and that you are worried about the poster. The person\u2019s family and friends may be able to reach the person better than you can. They may be aware of a suicide plan already in place that you don\u2019t know about. For example, you may say, \"I saw a post on Jane's Facebook page where she threatened to commit suicide. I am concerned about her and wasn't sure if you knew about this post.\"\n2. Reach out to the person. You may want to reach out to the person and offer support. Start off by offering to listen to the person. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask, \u201cAre you thinking about suicide?\u201d and \u201cWhat has led you to feel this way?\u201d Listen as the person shares their feelings with you. Comfort the person. Be kind, gentle, and supportive as you let the person know that you are there for them. Let the person know that you are concerned about them. Say, \u201cI am concerned about your safety and your life. You are important.\u201d\n\t* Tell the person you care about them and they mean something to you. For example, say, \u201cYou are important to me. I care about you.\u201d You may even want to pay them a visit if you live close to the person and know them well.\n3. Call emergency services. If a person is threatening to commit suicide, they need help. If you believe they need immediate help because they are going to commit suicide very soon, call 911 or other emergency services. Do not feel bad or embarrassed about calling for help. A threat of suicide is serious and needs to be dealt with accordingly. When you contact emergency services, tell them that the person is threatening to commit suicide via Facebook and you are concerned about their safety and life. You can also try calling a suicide prevention hotline yourself to ask for help with how to deal with the situation.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Do what you can. You may get extremely upset if you see someone you know or care about threatening to commit suicide. You should do what you can to help the person, but then let it go. Don\u2019t let yourself get inappropriately emotionally invested in the situation. You cannot control what the person does, only what you do to help. Once you have helped, there is nothing more you can do. You can check up on the person and offer support as they deal with the aftermath of the suicide threat. However, make sure to set up boundaries to protect your own mental health. Remember that you can only control your life and not the other person\u2019s. To set up boundaries, start by addressing what is in your power to do. This may be calling 911, contacting their family, or reaching out to them and listening. Next, you should do what you can. Tell yourself, \"These are the actions that are within my control to do.\" Then, remove yourself emotionally from the situation. You can only control what you do, not what they do. Remind yourself, \"I have done what I could do. I am not in control of the other person. I now will have to let it go and take care of myself.\"\n2. Refrain from being the person\u2019s counselor. You should not try to counsel the person yourself. Reaching out to the person, checking on them to gauge their mental status, and letting them know you care are important things you can do. However, you should let the professionals counsel the person. Don\u2019t try to give the person advice or convince them not to commit suicide. You are not a trained suicide counselor, so you should leave that to the professionals. You may say something to trigger a negative response or something that may upset the person\u2019s fragile emotional and mental state.\n3. Talk to a counselor. If you have helped someone who threatened suicide on Facebook, the experience may have taken an emotional toll on you. You may want to discuss your experience and feelings with a trained counselor who can help you sort through any grief, guilt, or other negative feelings. Even if the person is fine, getting involved may affect you. Instead of trying to \u201cget over it\u201d on your own, talk through the experience with someone trained in dealing with these situations. You may say to the counselor, \"I recently had someone I know threaten to commit suicide on Facebook. This really affected me. I cannot imagine the world without this person, and I keep worrying that they are going to go through with it. I know I am obsessing about this, and I need help to learn how to cope.\"\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":681}

{"conversations":["I am writing a story where a species undergoes devolution. Is there any scientific or plausible way to do this? The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. \nTo be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him\/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ","Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools. Within another 100,000 years your species that was formerly well on their way to developing things like agriculture, warfare, and tribal societies has reverted back to dumb grazers that simply live to eat and reproduce."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":270}
{"conversations":["Would a bullet made from ice be capable of killing somebody at 100 metres before melting?","The short answer is probably no.\nIt would either shatter because of the amount of force the weapon puts on it or melt because of the heat (in case of a regular combustion gun). The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon.","what makes you think it would shatter? The force distribution over the back end of the projectile should be fairly even, so i don't quite see that happening. Also, the barrel holds it together while the force is applied.","The fact is that a bullet made of ice is significantly less elastic than a regular one, and it wouldn't be able to dissipate the thrust force fast enough. A lead bullet (or whatever metal) gets deformed by the explosion (and gets compressed) and, due do the elasticity of metal, goes back to its original shape. An ice bullet, instead, would not modify its structure and, in the first few milliseconds after the gun is fired, the bullet will be shut between the power of the explosion and the pressure of the air coming from outside the barrel, and without being able to compress, it will shatter."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1015}

{"conversations":["When an expendable booster rocket stage nears the end of its burn, does the guidance computer shut the engine(s) off at a certain velocity\/altitude for the mission, or does the stage completely exhaust its propellants?","First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and\/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard.

Because it behaves exactly like the companion, but it must have a name.\nIs there maybe a difference in its \"static\" (I'm from the java side) lifecycle? ","There are two different types of ```object``` uses, expression and declaration.\nObject Expression\nAn object expression can be used when a class needs slight modification, but it's not necessary to create an entirely new subclass for it.  Anonymous inner classes are a good example of this.\n```button.setOnClickListener(object: View.OnClickListener() {\n    override fun onClick(view: View) {\n        \/\/ click event\n    }\n})\n```\nOne thing to watch out for is that anonymous inner classes can access variables from the enclosing scope, and these variables do not have to be ```final```.  This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        \/\/ return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.  Here's an example of a class with instance methods and companion methods.\n```class MyClass {\n  companion object MyCompanionObject {\n    fun actsAsStatic() {\n      \/\/ do stuff\n    }\n  }\n  fun instanceMethod() {\n    \/\/ do stuff\n  }\n}\n```\nInvoking the instance method would look like this.\n```var myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.instanceMethod()\n```\nInvoking the companion object method would look like this.\n```MyClass.actsAsStatic()\n```\nSee the Kotlin docs for more info."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":103}

{"conversations":["I am wondering how to generate uniformly distributed points on the surface of the 3-d unit sphere? Also after generating those points, what is the best way to visualize and check whether they are truly uniform on the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$?","A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1\/\\lambda, X_2\/\\lambda, X_3\/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3\/(4 \\pi \/ 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.  By computing all interpoint distances you can compare the data to this ideal.\nGeneral principles of constructing statistical graphics suggest a good way to make the comparison is to plot variance-stabilized residuals $e_i(d_{[i]} - e_i)$ against $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n(n-1)\/2=m$ where $d_{[i]}$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ smallest of the mutual distances and $e_i = 2\\sqrt{i\/m}$.  The plot should be close to zero. "],"source":"stackexchange","idx":41}
{"conversations":["How to match paint colors?","Whether you need to touch up a scratch on your living room wall or your child wants their bedroom to be the exact same color as their favorite toy, it can be difficult to find a perfect match to an existing paint color. Luckily, there are plenty of tricks and tools that can help you find the color you\u2019re looking from, including using paint samples, smartphone apps, and in-store computerized color matching!\n\n## Match paint without a sample\n\n1. Clean the area you're trying to paint match. Over time, fingerprints, dust, and dirt can collect on the surface of an object or a wall, and this can make the paint color seem darker than it actually is. To make sure you're testing the actual color, wipe the paint down with a damp, soapy sponge, and allow it to dry completely before you try to match the color. In addition to giving you a more accurate color match, cleaning the wall will help the new paint adhere better.\n2. Scrape off a 1 in (2.5 cm) sample of drywall paint with a razor knife. If you\u2019re trying to match paint on sheetrock or drywall, the easiest way to get a perfect match is to bring a sample with you to the paint store. Use a utility knife to score a square into the surface of the sheetrock about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) deep, then peel away the paper. Place the sample in a plastic bag or an envelope so it doesn\u2019t get smudged before you get to the paint store. Once the store has analyzed the color, dab a little of the paint onto a corner of the sample and let it dry to ensure it\u2019s a perfect match.\n3. Bring the item you\u2019re matching to the paint store if it's portable. Thanks to the computerized color-matching technology at most paint stores, you can match almost anything! If you\u2019re trying to find a paint that\u2019s the same color as an object, you can bring that object in with you when you go to buy paint. The staff at the paint store will then scan the item and come up with an exact or near-exact digital match to the color of the object. If there\u2019s not an existing color that matches your object, the paint store can mix one up for you.\n\n\n## Find a match with an app\n\n1. Download a paint-matching app if you can\u2019t take a sample. Most major paint brands have their own apps for matching paint colors, including Sherwin-Williams, BEHR, Glidden, and Valspar. Visit the app store on your smartphone and choose an app that will scan your wall color and provide you with a color match. If you remember the brand you used originally, download their app. If you don\u2019t know the brand, try a few different apps to see which gives you the closest match, or try an app like Paint My Place which uses multiple paint brands.\n2. Scan your paint in natural lighting for the best result. Differences in lighting can make your paint more yellow or more blue, depending on which type of light is being used. To avoid these inconsistencies, try to test your paint sample in an area with plenty of natural light if you can, like near an open window or door. Since natural light changes throughout the day, it may help to take a color reading in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If your room doesn\u2019t have much natural light, use the room\u2019s primary light source to test the paint. Incandescent lights will make paint seem warmer, while fluorescent lights look cooler. Halogen bulbs more closely resemble daylight.\n3. Test the paint in an inconspicuous area to make sure it\u2019s a good match. Differences in lighting and cameras can make digital paint matching imprecise. If you purchase paint based on the results you get from an app, be sure to test it somewhere where the difference won\u2019t be obvious. Let the paint dry completely before you check whether it\u2019s a match, since wet paint can look like a different color at first.\n4. Purchase or borrow a color scanner for a more precise match. Apps rely on your smartphone\u2019s camera to get a color match, but you can get more accurate results with a small device that scans paint colors using an independent camera with its own lighting. If you\u2019ll be doing a lot of color matching, it can be worth the investment. These color scanners are $65-$100 at most home stores and connect to your phone via Bluetooth.\n\n\n## Use a color sample\n\n1. Take a picture of the original color before you go to the paint store. If you\u2019re planning to pick up color samples from the paint store, take along a photo of the original paint. Pictures won\u2019t give you an exact color match, but they can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to remember the general hue. If you can, try snapping pictures at different times of day, since the changes in lighting will make the paint look different. If you\u2019re in a hurry and don\u2019t have time to wait a few hours for the light to change, try taking pictures with the flash on and off, or with the main light on, followed by lamplight. Holding up a true white piece of paper or cardstock in the picture can help your camera to automatically correct the color balance.\n2. Choose a handful of samples to bring home with you. The lighting in the paint aisle won\u2019t be the same as it is in your home, and different shades can seem really similar, so it\u2019s important to bring the paint samples to the wall to compare the colors. Choose a handful of colors that seem close to the shade you want to match. If you\u2019re not sure what brand the original color was, be sure to get shades from several different brands, as well. If you like, you can also purchase or borrow a fan deck of colors from the paint store so you\u2019ll have access to all of the shades a particular brand offers.\n3. Tape the samples to the wall and examine them at different times of day. It can be tempting to just hold up the samples and immediately choose which one is the closest, but since the color of the room will change slightly as the sun moves throughout the day, you should hang the samples and come back to them every couple of hours. Of course, if none of the samples are a match, you will probably be able to tell right away. If one sample is a match early in the day and another matches better in the evening, ask the paint store if they can mix a shade in between.\n4. Paint a small section of each color on the wall if you\u2019re still not sure. Most paint stores will sell you a small can of paint that you can use to paint a sample. If you can\u2019t decide between 2 or 3 different shades, purchase a sample size of each. Paint a small swatch of each color onto the wall and look at them for a few days before making your final decision. In addition to changes in light throughout the day, changes in weather can also affect your paint color. Your swatches might look different on a sunny day than they do on a day when that\u2019s overcast.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":657}

We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":159}

{"conversations":["How to ride the london eye?","The London Eye is an iconic part of London\u2019s cityscape. It\u2019s a giant ferris wheel, built in 2000 to commemorate the new millennium. It\u2019s made up of 32 large glass capsules that move slowly, allowing riders to get a great view London\u2019s most famous sights. To ride the London Eye, you\u2019ll need to find your way there, find the right package for your needs, and know some of its security and logistical characteristics.\n\n## Book your ride on the london eye\n\n1. Choose your package. The London Eye offers a variety of experiences at different prices. Standard tickets put you in a capsule with around 20 other people, where you can ride the Eye for about 30 minutes. There are quite a few packages beyond the standard ticket, including:\n\t* Fast track tickets, which let you jump ahead of the queue and board the Eye more quickly. Flexi tickets let you visit the London Eye at any time of day rather than booking a specific time in advance. Combination packages let you save money by combining London Eye tickets with passes for other London attractions, such as the London Dungeon or Madame Tussauds.\n2. Book your ticket online. Visiting the London Eye\u2019s official website will let you buy your ticket ahead of time, saving a bit of wait time. Additionally, you\u2019ll be able to save 10% on the ticket price by paying online. After choosing your package, you\u2019ll be able to pay online with a credit card or PayPal. After buying your ticket, you\u2019ll have the option to print your ticket at home or collect it at the London Eye. The former will save you more wait time.\n3. Pay on the spot. While it\u2019s more convenient to book tickets online, it\u2019s also possible to queue up at the London Eye for your ticket. You\u2019ll have directions on site as to where to line up to buy your ticket. Note that while this is possible, it\u2019s usually best to pre book for the London Eye, especially with more exclusive packages.\n\n\n## Find your way to the london eye\n\n1. Take the tube or train. There are a few train stations near the London Eye, which are accessible by train or by using the subway. The closest station is Waterloo, which is about a five minute walk from the London Eye if you follow signs for the South Bank. Alternatively, you can reach the London Eye from the Embankment and Charing Cross stations; you\u2019ll need to cross the Hungerford Bridge to reach the London Eye from these stations.\n2. Get on the bus. There are three bus lines that can take you directly to Waterloo station, close to the London Eye. The bus line you take depends on your starting point. The 211 bus line travels between Hammersmith Bus Station and the Waterloo station. The 77 line also has its final stop at Waterloo station, although it starts from Tooting Station. The 381 is your last option, and starts from Peckham Bus Station.\n3. Take a taxi. The fare will vary depending on where you\u2019re leaving from, but the London Eye has a dedicated drop off location for taxis at the end of its landscape. They also tend to congregate there, ready to take you back to a hotel or to your next destination. If you opt for using Uber instead of a taxi, you\u2019re usually looking at a minimum fare of \u00a314, ($18.13) with rates of \u00a30.08 ($0.10) per minute and \u00a30.75 ($0.97) per mile.\n4. Park your car at Q-Park Westminster car park. Whether you\u2019re picking up a rental car or driving with a local, this is the best place to park and the London Eye can get you a 15% discount. From there, it\u2019s a 5 minute walk to the London Eye, across either the Westminster Bridge or Lambeth Bridge. Note that the London Eye is situated in the London Congestion Zone. This means you\u2019ll be charged \u00a311.50 ($14.89) for driving to the London Eye on a weekday between 7am and 6pm.\n\n\n## Get on the eye\n\n1. Know what you can and can\u2019t take with you. The London Eye has an important list of restricted items. Many of these will be taken from you at a security check before entry, and returned to you once you disembark. This list includes, but is not limited to:\n\t* Sharp objects, from knives to nail files. Replica or toy guns. Large bags or rucksacks. Skateboards and rollerblades.\n2. Prepare to wait in line. It can take at least 45 minutes to board the London Eye, with wait times increasing during peak times, especially on weekends and holidays. It\u2019s suggested that you arrive at least 30 minutes before your booked time; this will allow you sufficient time to collect your tickets and join the queue. If you have a standard entry, you\u2019ll enter the capsule through the standard queue. The Fast Track queue can only be accessed if you have a Fast Track ticket and allows for shorter queue times.\n3. Move about the capsule for the best view. The London Eye capsules offer a full 360 degree view, and it moves slowly enough to guarantee a you\u2019ll catch all of London\u2019s sights. While the capsule can hold up to 28 people, you should still be able to move around and get a good view. The ride takes about 30 minutes, so make sure to keep your eyes open.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":790}

The only emergency transponder in the escape pod isn't working probably due to the destruction of the spacecraft. Given the technology of 1999, is it possible for us to sent out a distress signal to alert the leaving patrol spacecraft?\nNote: the cellphone was the most innovative product of 1999 money can buy.\nThe escape pod is not a Faraday cage we're talking about the future and the patrol spacecraft don't necessary be on a lookout for distress signal; please use these clues to your advantage.\nIf there is absolutely no way to transmit any man-made signal out, please state a valid reason why it can't be done.","Assets\n\n* 1 obsolete piece of short range comms kit requiring a battery you probably can't charge\n* 1 slightly malfunctioning escape pod with up to date comms that isn't working but you're still alive\n\nCurrent standards say the Mayday should be broadcast on VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz). A 1999 phone, probably on 2g would likely use 900MHz (UHF). The slightly broken comms unit in the pod is probably using channel 16 or equivalent*. This is your first problem. The patrol ship will be listening in for signals broadcast on the mayday frequency. That's the frequency you need to hit, so first up is rebuilding your phone to that frequency.\n\nOr you could look at the pod comms system and see what's wrong.\n\nYour next problem is that your mobile phone's range is laughable in interstellar space. What's going to be even more laughable is when you try to use it in the radiation shielded environment of your escape pod. The signal, which is line of sight at the best of times, most likely won't even penetrate the hull. So now you need to hook it up to the external antenna used by the pod's own comms system.\n\nOr you could look at the pod comms system and see what's wrong.\n\nNow you need to make sure you're using the right broadcast method: are you on AM or FM?

Fix the pod.\nUltimately all you're going to do is rebuild a copy of the pod's own comms system with a batch of obsolete components. If you're good enough to do that you're good enough to fix the pod's own system which will be much easier.\n\n*I mention channel 16 as an example to show that there are standards for distress signals and they're very different from the standards for mobiles, if you want someone to pick it up then you need to be broadcasting on a frequency they're listening on.\n\n## Distress frequencies\n\n  2182 kHz forms an essential part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). It has an associated DSC frequency at 2187.5 kHz. Other international distress frequencies, in use as of 2008, include:\n\n```121.5 MHz - civil aircraft emergency frequency\n243 MHz - military aircraft emergency frequency\n156.8 MHz - Marine VHF radio channel 16, short range maritime use\n406 MHz \/ 406.1 MHz - Cospas-Sarsat international satellite-based search and rescue (SAR) distress alert detection and information distribution system\n```\n\nDiscontinued frequencies\n```500 kHz Morse code is no longer monitored.\n121.5 or 243 MHz locators.

What are static classes good for?","Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        \/\/ MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); \/\/ results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n\/\/ A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { \/\/ private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and\/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```.

Assuming a single-threaded application (as most are), your entire application will stop responding, rather than just delaying an operation as you probably intended. Note that it may be fine to use Sleep in pure console application as there are no \"events\" to handle or on separate thread (also ```Task.Delay``` is better option).\nIn addition to timers and ```Sleep``` you can use ```Task.Delay``` which is asynchronous version of ```Sleep``` that does not block thread from processing events (if used properly - don't turn it into infinite sleep with ```.Wait()```). \n``` public async void ClickHandler(...)\n {\n      \/\/ whatever you need to do before delay goes here\n      await Task.Delay(2000);\n      \/\/ whatever you need to do after delay.\n }\n```\nThe same ```await Task.Delay(2000)``` can be used in a ```Main``` method of a console application if you use C# 7.1 (Async main on MSDN blogs).\nNote: delaying operation with ```Sleep``` has benefit of avoiding race conditions that comes from potentially starting multiple operations with timers\/```Delay```.

For example if it is a class member function or constructor which stores or initializes the ```std::function``` into a member variable.","If you want performance, pass by value if you are storing it.\n\nSuppose you have a function called \"run this in the UI thread\".\n```std::future run_in_ui_thread( std::function )\n```\nwhich runs some code in the \"ui\" thread, then signals the ```future``` when done.

Except the ```run_in_ui_thread``` is going to make a copy of its function argument to send to the ui thread to execute! (it will return before it is done with it, so it cannot just use a reference to it).  For case (A), we simply ```move``` the ```std::function``` into its long-term storage.  In case (B), we are forced to copy the ```std::function```.\nThat store makes passing by value more optimal.  If there is any possibility you are storing a copy of the ```std::function```, pass by value.  Otherwise, either way is roughly equivalent: the only downside to by-value is if you are taking the same bulky ```std::function``` and having one sub method after another use it.  Barring that, a ```move``` will be as efficient as a ```const&```.\nNow, there are some other differences between the two that mostly kick in if we have persistent state within the ```std::function```.\nAssume that the ```std::function``` stores some object with a ```operator() const```, but it also has some ```mutable``` data members which it modifies (how rude!).\nIn the ```std::function const&``` case, the ```mutable``` data members modified will propagate out of the function call.

Are there any specific scenarios where one notation would be preferable to another?","You are referring to the Landau notation. They are not different symbols for the same thing but have entirely different meanings. Which one is \"preferable\" depends entirely on the desired statement.\n$f \\in \\cal{O}(g)$ means that $f$ grows at most as fast as $g$, asymptotically and up to a constant factor; think of it as a $\\leq$. $f \\in o(g)$ is the stricter form, i.e. $\n$f \\in \\Omega(g)$ has the symmetric meaning: $f$ grows at least as fast as $g$. $\\omega$ is its stricter cousin. You can see that $f \\in \\Omega(g)$ is equivalent to $g \\in \\cal{O}(f)$.\n$f \\in \\Theta(g)$ means that $f$ grows about as fast as $g$; formally $f \\in \\cal{O}(g) \\cap \\Omega(g)$. $f \\sim g$ (asymptotic equality) is its stronger form. We often mean $\\Theta$ when we use $\\cal{O}$.\nNote how $\\cal{O}(g)$ and its siblings are function classes. It is important to be very aware of this and their precise definitions -- which can differ depending on who is talking -- when doing \"arithmetics\" with them. \nWhen proving things, take care to work with your precise definition. There are many definitions for Landau symbols around (all with the same basic intuition), some of which are equivalent on some sets on functions but not on others.\n\nIf you are interested in using Landau notation in a rigorous and sound manner, you may be interested in a work by Rutanen et al..

Each table row acts like a link, sort of like you'd see on a YouTube playlist next to the video player.\nWhen a user visits the page, the option they are on is supposed to go to the top of the scrolling div. This functionality is working. The issue is that it goes just a tad too far. Like the option they are on is about 10px too high. So, the page is visited, the url is used to identify which option was selected and then scrolls that option to the top of the scrolling div. Note: This is not the scroll bar for the window, it is a div with a scrollbar.\nI am using this code to make it move the selected option to the top of the div:\n```var pathArray = window.location.pathname.split( '\/' );\nvar el = document.getElementById(pathArray[5]);\nel.scrollIntoView(true);\n```\nIt moves it to the top of the div but about 10 pixels too far up.\nhow to fix that?","CSS ```scroll-margin``` and ```scroll-padding```\nYou might want to have a look at new CSS properties ```scroll-padding``` and ```scroll-margin```.

{"conversations":["I have heard multiple times in photography, the words Bokeh, and Gaussian Blur. To me, it seems that the words are used almost interchangeably, but in some instances, I have heard them contrasted. What's the difference, and what are the definitions of each of them?","Bokeh is specifically the out-of-focus areas of an image. Gaussian blur is an algorithm to fog selected image areas, to hide details or make them look out of focus.\nThe main differences:\n\n* bokeh is created optically, gaussian blur in post-production;\n* in bokeh, the amount of how wide an out-of-focus point will be smeared is determined by its relative distance from focal plane, whereas gaussian blur is applied to a two-dimensional image where no distance information is present, thus all points are smeared equally;\n* in bokeh, the smearing characteristics depend on configuration and aperture shape of the lens, whereas gaussian blur is always smooth;\n* a small light source will be rendered as an aperture-shaped figure with quite well-defined edges in bokeh; but gaussian blur renders it as a spot with fading edges;\n* in bokeh, noise is present at the same level as in in-focus parts of image with same luminance; gaussian blur kills noise, so there'll be less noise than in non-blurred parts of image;\n* in bokeh, light areas will dominate over dark ones, while gaussian blur gives preserves the ratio of dark-light areas.\n\nSo, all in all, you can use one to fake another, but the result will be similar only for low-noise bokeh containing items on roughly a plane parallel to focal plane, not including any significantly lighter areas or light sources, and taken with a lens that has a smooth bokeh."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":144}
{"conversations":["There are several questions here about the definition of depth of field, about focal length, and about subject distance. And of course there's the basic how does aperture affect my photographs. And plenty of how do I get super-shallow d.o.f questions. There's related questions like this one. But there's no be-all-end-all question asking:\nWhat exactly determines depth of field in a photograph? \nIs it just a property of the lens? Can lenses be designed to give more depth of field for the same aperture and focal length? Does it change with camera sensor size? Does it change with print size? How do those last two relate?","I'm going to dispense with the formulas, photos of rulers and definitions of \"magnification\" and go with what you actually experience in practice. The major factors that actually matter to shooting are:\n\n* Aperture. Wide aperture lenses give you a shallower depth of field. This is probably the least controversial factor! This is important as some lenses have much larger apertures e.g. 18-55 f\/3.5-5.6 vs. 50 f\/1.8 \n* Subject distance. This is a really important consideration. Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase \/ decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n"],"source":"stackexchange","idx":308}
{"conversations":["How to flirt with a co worker (for women)?","Flirting with coworkers can relieve workplace tension and monotony. Some women flirt because they are interested in starting a romantic relationship with one of their coworkers. Others do it just for fun. Workplace flirting requires extra precautions because you must remain professional. You can still encourage some playful interaction between you and your coworker by engaging in friendly conversation, adjusting your body language, and dressing in a flirtatious but professional way.\n\n## Interact with your coworker\n\n1. Chat with them. Men tend to interpret friendly and talkative women as flirty. Find excuses to chat with them when they are not busy. Some things you can try:\n\t* Talk about hobbies, interests, and plans outside of work. \"Any big plans for the weekend? I've been dying to see this new movie myself.\" Praise their recent accomplishments or awards: \"I heard you just received an award! Any plans to celebrate?\" Ask them about current projects by saying, \"Hey, how is that current project going? Are you hanging in there?\"\n2. Laugh at their jokes. If your coworker makes a joke or says something even slightly funny, laugh. Laughing is a gentle way of flirting. It should not feel forced, nor should it seem as though you are laughing at your coworker.\n3. Compliment them. Appreciate the work that they do around the office, and praise them for their strengths. You want to make sure that you are appreciating their skills, abilities, and personality instead of their looks. Some good, flirty compliments include:\n\t* \"Great job on that last presentation. You'll have to give me some tips.\" \"Thanks for helping with that last project. You make my life so much easier around here.\" \"You have such good ideas. How do you come up with them?\" Be extremely careful with workplace compliments. If it seems as though the recipient is awkward or uncomfortable, stop immediately.\n4. Ask them for help. Asking people to help you can increase their self-esteem and confidence, which encourages them to flirt back with you. It also shows that you appreciate their strengths in a work-friendly manner. It can even encourage them to spend more time with you. Some ways you try this include:\n\t* \"Hey, you're good with technology, right? Can you help me with my computer?\" \"Do you mind listening to me practice my presentation? I'd love to get your feedback on this.\" \"Can you help me lock up tomorrow night?\"\n5. Hang out around their desk. Find excuses to drop by their desk. Perhaps you have a question about your project. Perhaps their desk is close to the coffee maker. As you pass by, make eye contact and ask them about their day. Walk by their desk, and try to catch their eye. If they look up at you, smile and ask, \"how's your day been?\" or \"Are you hanging in there?\" You can also ask, \"how is the work going? Do you want to take a coffee break?\" This gives them the opportunity to start a conversation if they are interested. Do not interrupt your coworker if they look as though they are busy with something else. Instead of being flirty, you might only annoy them.\n6. Invite them out to coffee or lunch. You may be feeling bolder, or you want to make the next step in your relationship. Instead of asking them to drinks or dinner, which can be too formal, try asking them if they would like to grab something to eat over your lunch break. Coffee is also a great way to bond with your coworker. A good way to ask is to just say, \"Hey, we should catch up over lunch. Do you want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?\"\n7. Respect their boundaries. Your first priority at work is to do your job. Be warned that flirting at work can get you in trouble if someone complains. If your coworker seems uncomfortable or asks you to stop, do not continue flirting with them. Give them space by only talking to them about work-related matters for a few weeks. Before you make any moves whatsoever, review your workplace sexual harassment rules, as well as rules about relationships in the workplace. You can also talk to someone in the HR department if you have any further questions. Make workplace friendly jokes that have no sexual innuendo. Never flirt with your boss. They are in a position of power, and any flirting can cause professional difficulties for both of you. It is best to flirt with coworkers on your pay grade. Do not flirt with a coworker who is married or in a relationship. Even if a married coworker enjoys your flirting, you are putting both of you in a difficult situation.\n\n\n## Express interest with body language\n\n1. Make eye contact. Eye contact is one of the primary tactics of flirtation. Brief glances can show your attraction and interest in another person. You can try looking across the room during a meeting or glancing across the table at lunch. Meet their eyes briefly before glancing down and away.\n2. Smile. Smiling is an open and friendly act that invites people to interact with you. In fact, smiling may be one of the best ways to meet new people and start new relationships. As your coworker passes your desk, glance up briefly and smile. If you catch their eye in a meeting, give them a quick grin. Don\u2019t linger. A small smile is all it takes.\n3. Show off your neck. When you know they are looking at you, try to casually flip your hair to show off your neck. This shows the curve of your neck while drawing attention to your hair. This is a casual but flirty move that makes it seem as though you are not deliberately trying to catch their attention.\n4. Lean over their desk. Leaning or orienting yourself towards another person signals that you are interested in them. You can practice this while working on a project with your coworker. Lean over the desk to point out something. Reach out so that your arm is crossing their body without touching them. If you\u2019re working on a shared computer, shift your body so that your feet and shoulders are tilted towards them.\n5. Avoid touching. While gently touching someone is often a form of flirting, it can get you in trouble in the workplace. Try to use body language that does not involve physical contact. If your touching is unwanted, you can get in trouble for harassment.\n\n\n## Increase your attractiveness\n\n1. Wear make-up. Many men find women who wear make-up more appealing. Men typically like to flirt more with women whom they find attractive, so making yourself more attractive is especially important if you want to flirt with a co-worker. Eye make-up in particular can increase your flirtatiousness.\n2. Put on heels. Heels can increase your attractiveness to men. The higher your heels, the more likely men are to approach you. High heels can push your pelvis and chest out, arch your backside, and make your legs look tighter and more muscular\u2014all of which make you more attractive.\n3. Apply light perfume. Perfume can boost your sex appeal but only if it is used sparingly. Spray once on your wrists. Rub your wrists together before dabbing them on your neck. This will give you just enough perfume to attract someone without annoying your other colleagues.\n4. Maintain professional standards. While you should look appealing to your coworker, you must keep in mind that you have to look professional as well. Follow your workplace\u2019s dress code. Avoid tight or short clothing that reveals too much skin. Instead, try to find clothes that fit your body\u2019s shape without being too revealing. If you can, try using eye catching colors instead of revealing clothing. Wear jewelry to draw attention to your neck and arms. Make sure that your hair is brushed and styled in a way that both accentuates your features and provides minimal distraction to you while working.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":746}

Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":216}

{"conversations":["How much does it cost to make a MOOC universally accessible, as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990?","The cost of making a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) universally accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of content the MOOC contains ( video \/ text \/ etc.). Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC. They can conduct a comprehensive evaluation and provide cost estimates tailored to your project's needs.","If captioning costs $5-$15 per minute, how does it become effectively free if you start out with it in mind?","Sorry for causing any confusions. The issue at hand is not the cost of MOOCs themselves, but rather the cost associated with compliance and accessibility, particularly regarding adherence to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for web materials. When it comes to creating web pages, recording audio and video, and other related tasks, there are indeed expenses involved. Some of these costs pertain to the production of web content, while others are specifically tied to ensuring compliance. However, if one plans for compliance from the outset, the process can be achieved at little to no additional expense."],"source":"multi_turn","idx":1018}
{"conversations":["According to the sources I have found, a lambda expression is essentially implemented by the compiler creating a class with overloaded function call operator and the referenced variables as members. This suggests that the size of lambda expressions varies, and given enough references variables that size can be arbitrarily large.\nAn ```std::function``` should have a fixed size, but it must be able to wrap any kind of callables, including any lambdas of the same kind. How is it implemented? If ```std::function``` internally uses a pointer to its target, then what happens, when the ```std::function``` instance is copied or moved? Are there any heap allocations involved?","The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n\/\/ ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```\/\/ g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    \/\/ prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    \/\/ prints 5\n   f3();                    \/\/ prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference. If the callable entity was shared by the different ```std::function<>``` objects, the output of the program would have been 5, 6, 7."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":252}

This altscreen has no history buffer and exits immediately when you quit the program, switching back to the original screen which restores the previous window content history and placement. \n\nYou can prevent ```less``` from launch in an altscreen by passing the argument \"-X\". \n```less -X \/path\/to\/some\/file```\n\nYou can also pass \"-X\" as an environment variable.

Here's a guide on how to make your What Not to Wear party one to remember!\n\n## Step\n\n1. You can do this party one of two ways: Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends\/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover! This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores. Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite\/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids\/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved. If you want, you can mix components of both parties.\n2. For both parties, assign your own family\/friends to be the cast of \"What not to Wear\". If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.\n3. For both parties, decorate your house\/party space just like the \"What not to Wear\" studio. Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.\n4. At the end of either party theme, eat cake\/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!\n\n\n## \"what not to wear\" replica theme\n\n1. When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.\n2. Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want). Then show them the pictures that your friends\/family sent in of them. Then tell them that they're going to get a huge makeover!\n3. Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).\n4. Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards). That will be their new wardrobe.\n5. Give your FF-PP a makeover! Do their makeup, nails, and hair.\n6. Reveal your made-over FF-PP to your guests.\n\n\n## Worst-dressed to best-dressed theme\n\n1. Send out invitations with the 'What not to Wear' logo on them, as well as pictures of Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, the hosts of the show. You can also have pictures of horrible outfits and put big red 'X's over them.\n2. Once everyone has arrived at the party, award your 'Worst-dressed Person' with a prize (something fashion-related, such as a pair of cute earrings).\n3. Have a 'worst-dressed' photo shoot. This is a lot of fun.\n4. Have 'Stacy' and 'Clinton' critique everyone's outfits, just like on the show.\n5. Tell your guests to get dressed in their favourite\/most fashionable outfits. If somebody forgets theirs, lend them one of your chic outfits!\n6. After your guests are all dressed up, it's time for a makeover! Have some makeup on-hand, as well as some nail polish for manicures. Also, give them to option of curling, straightening, and\/or crimping their hair.\n7. After everyone's makeovers are finished, announce the \"Best-Dressed Award\". Give them a prize similar to the winner of the \"Worst-Dressed Award\".\n8. Once the \"Best-Dressed Award\" has been handed out, it's time for a photo shoot! Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.\n9. Have your guests be revealed to 'Stacy' and 'Clinton'. Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says \"Shut up!\" frequently (she says \"Shut up!\" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).\n10.

{"conversations":["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.","Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":228}

I remember voice output with programs like telephone answering programs. The sound was wimpy but I attributed most of the quality to speaker size.\nWhat was lacking with the original PC sound chip? ","> The original IBM PC and later variants used an Intel 8253 or 8254 as a sound chip.\n\nThe 8253 is a timer circuit, containing three timers able to generate timed interrupts or square-wave output with programmed frequencies. On the PC the third timer's output is, via an amplifier, connected to a simple speaker.\n\nAs said before, calling a 'simple' timer a sound chip is quite a stretch. \nSince it's a digital output, no level control is available. Only on or off is possible. At best this results in rather nasty sounding square waves. There is no provision to smooth the signal (beside the inertia of the speaker membrane).\n\nAlso, the only frequencies that can be selected are those that result from dividing the base frequency (1,193,181.8 Hz) by an integer in the range of 1&ndash;65535. So even when accepting the meager signal quality, only very few notes can be played at correct frequency. Already the basic 440 Hz concert pitch will be off by .5Hz. So whatever is played using the timer will sound off pitch. Music can still sound good if a little off pitch, but only when all notes are off in the same way (*1) - which is not the case with this 'sound chip'.\n\nOf course, there are also ways to manipulate the sound even a bit better by manually handling the output - which results in 100% CPU time usage.\n\n> Why did users add sound cards such as the Adlib or Sound Blaster.\n\nSimply because they wanted sound - or at least music. Not just a beeper.\n\n> What was lacking with the original PC sound chip?\n\nAs said before, it's no sound chip at all. A sound chip will need programmable oscillators for different wave forms and at least some analogue ciruitry to make a smooth, more natural sound. Ofcourse, from an enginering point, the PC's use of a timer was a great improvement over the Apple II, its model and competition, as it allowed the beeping in parallel - not that this feature was used by BIOS or DOS.\nLast but not least, the PC is an open system. It is made to add new\/better hardware. So why shoudn't there be a real sound card? Improving the machine is a core feature of the design.\n\nAddendum:\nagtoever added a comment with a great example of what was possible with the direct fiddling with the speaker. Awesome, but less than apealing when compared to even the cheapest form of soundcard, the AdLib of the same time, as used by Monkey Island. Next to zero CPU usage and crisp clear sound. Not to mention easy programming. I'd call that a huge advantage.\n\n*1 - The average human decodes frequencies relative to each other. As a result sound is still perceived as good, even if the whole scale is shifted, as long as it's in the same direction and same percentage. Output needs to be way off to be noticed by an average listener. In contrast, if notes are off by a different margin and in different directions, even less trained listeners will notice."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":251}

Is there a historical explanation, was the volt introduced at a different time?","The volt, ohm and farad were introduced by the same person, Latimer Clark, a cable engineer, in a paper in 1861. He started the tradition of naming units after scientists. He initially distorted all names: the unit names ohma, volt, galvat (from Galvani), and farad (from Faraday). In his words, he \"neglected etymological rules\". \n\nIn that same year, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science began developing a coherent system of electrical units, the cgs system. Varley, a committee member, liked Clark's proposal, but he advocated adding a French name such as Ampere, to facilitate the international acceptance of the new units (\"I should like to introduce a French name into the list. We have Germany, England and Italy represented\"). For the same reason he may have pleaded for not distorting the French and German names. In addition, Varley objected to the galvat \"because Galvani discovered next to nothing\".\n\nLatimer Clark adapted the unit names in his 'Elementary treatise on electrical measurement' (1868). He changed ohma to ohm, and dropped the galvat. Maxwell acknowledged Clark's practical units and their names in his 'Treatise on electricity and magnetism' (1873). In 1881, at the International Electrical Congress in Paris), two French names, ampere and coulomb, were added. The diplomacy worked, and the new system of electrical units was adopted by all countries.

When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you\u2019ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:\n\t* Exodus (Ex)\n\t* Genesis (Gen)\n\t* Numbers (Num)\n2. Identify the chapter. After the book name, you\u2019ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d, \u201c3\u201d is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter it is from in the book. Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13. Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter. As with other books, it should clearly say, \u201cChapter \\_\\_\u201d at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, many versions clearly say,  : at the top of each page indicating the first verse on that page. Some also note the last verse on the page.\n3. Identify the verse number. The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number. If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.\n4. Locate the verse within the chapter. Once you\u2019ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16.\n\n\n## Look up a verse with a concordance\n\n1. Choose a concordance. A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word\u2019s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don\u2019t know which book or chapter it came from. Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.\n2. Search for a word from the verse. Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized. Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as \u201cflood,\u201d \u201cmountain,\u201d or \u201crubies.\u201d If you choose something like \u201clove\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d you\u2019re likely to find an enormous number of results.\n3. Search for other words if necessary. If you find too many results, or you don\u2019t see the verse you\u2019re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, \u201clove must be sincere\u201d and you searched \u201clove\u201d but found too many results, try looking up, \u201csincere.\u201d\n4. Locate the verse from the concordance list. The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it\u2019s the verse you\u2019re looking for. Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.\n5. Try another translation if necessary. Concordances are specific to translations. If you can\u2019t find the verse you\u2019re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word \u201cpraise,\" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as \u201cworship,\u201d it will be impossible to look up the verse.\n\n\n## Look up a verse online\n\n1. Search the verse number online. Choose a search engine, or go to a website dedicated to Bible study. Type the name of the book and the chapter and verse numbers into the search engine. Type the verse number in the generally accepted format if you can. For example, you'll get more accurate results if you type, \"John 3:16,\" than, \"Chapter 3 16 John.\"\n2. Remember what you can about the verse. Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can\u2019t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse.\n3. Enter what you know into a search engine. Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words \u201cBible\u201d and \u201cverse\u201d to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search. Your search terms may be something like, \u201cBible verse about wives in Psalms,\u201d or \u201cBible verse chapter 7 desert.\u201d\n4. Use a site designed for Bible searches. There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter. These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.\n5. Search related words. If you can\u2019t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for \u201cstars\u201d and didn\u2019t find anything, you could search for \u201cnight\u201d or \u201csky\u201d or \u201cheavens\u201d to see if the verse shows up. It\u2019s possible you\u2019re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":649}

{"conversations":["How to drill at an angle?","Drilling at an angle can seem difficult, but don't worry, there's several methods you can use to create angled holes. You can try some basic tricks if you don't need your angles to be too exact. Otherwise, try building an angled jig with a piece of wood for your hand drill, or creating an angled jig that fits onto the plate of your drill press.\n\n## Use basic trick for imprecise angle\n\n1. Use a speed square to gauge your angle for quick drill jobs. A speed square is a right-triangle shaped tool that has angles marked along the hypotenuse (the long side). Use the angles on the edge to guide your drilling. Set the speed square right next to the hole you're drilling. Line up the drill so the top is along the flat side of the speed square. It will almost look like you're drilling into the right angle. Line up the angle markings on the hypotenuse with the center line down the top of the drill. Drill down into the wood at that angle.\n2. Cut a guide from scrap wood to keep the same angle for several holes. Measure the angle you need on a flat piece of scrap wood that's at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut the wood at that angle using a hand saw or radial saw. To cut the wood at an angle, mark the angle along the edge. Use a handsaw to go along that angle. If you're using a radial saw, set it to the angle you need before cutting. Set the wood down where you need to drill. Lay the drill along the angle, and use the wood to guide the drill while pushing into the wood. Make sure to hold on tight to the guiding piece of wood while drilling.\n3. Start with pilot holes to create angled pocket holes. Another option is to drill straight down into the wood to create small pilot holes. You only need to go down about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Pull the drill out. Start drilling again with the drill angled straight down into the pilot holes you've created, and then tilt it to the angle you need as you go in the hole. Pocket holes are what you use to connect 2 pieces of wood at an angle. The angle doesn't need to be precise, so you don't need to measure it. Aim for about a 45\u00b0 angle, and you should be fine. This method helps keep the drill bit from breaking.\n\n\n## Employ an angle jig\n\n1. Create your own angled jig with a piece of wood. Make this tool using a radial saw and a scrap piece of wood. Use a radial saw and set it to the angle of the hole that you need to drill into your wood. For example, if you need it set to 30 degrees, then set the radial saw to 30 degrees. \"Jig\" literally just means something that holds your work or guides your tools. Use your radial saw to cut the wood at an angle.\n2. Add a pilot hole to the angled jig by drilling into the angled edge. Drill into the angled part of the wood so that the drill is perpendicular to the wood. This will create the perfect angle for drilling into other pieces of wood. Drill all the way through the wood to make the pilot hole.\n3. Position the wood on your workbench to drill. Place the piece of wood that you need to drill into on your workbench. Put the angled jig over the flat piece. You should see the pilot hole you drilled in the angled part. Clamp the jig into place on top of the other piece of wood. If the jig isn't flat along the top, you can saw off the top edge to make it flat. Then you'll be able to clamp it to the other piece of wood.\n4. Drill through the jig into the wood below to create holes in your project. Next, place the drill bit through the pilot hole. Start drilling, using the pilot hole as a guide. Push down into the piece underneath, creating an angled hole. Once you know how deep you want to go for each pilot hole you're creating in your project, apply a stop collar to the drill to keep yourself from going deeper. The stop collar goes over the drill bit at the place you want to stop. A stop collar is a little metal ring that you can buy at any home improvement store. Move the jig around to each spot you need to drill a hole.\n\n\n## Create an angle jig for a drill press\n\n1. Cut a piece of plywood to fit your drill press plate. Use a table saw to cut the piece down to size, making it perfectly rectangular. It should fit easily on top of your drill press plate, though keep it mind you will angle it up towards the drill. You can trace the drill press plate to get an idea for the size you'll need. You can use scrap plywood for this project, but it should be sturdy enough so that it doesn't bend when you're drilling down towards it.\n2. Add a fence to the front of the piece of plywood. Screw a small piece of wood onto the front of the plywood. The front is whatever part will be facing up on the drill press plate. The wood should be almost the length of the plywood and 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. When looking at the plywood as you face the drill press, this piece should run from top to bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the left edge. Some fences also run from left to right 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the bottom instead. A fence helps you keep your project in place.\n3. Screw a piece of wood to the back of the plywood to create the angle. The bracing piece of wood should be 1 in (2.5 cm) wide or so, but the height of the wood to the press plate will be determined by the angle you want. Measure the angle, and cut the piece of wood so that it will prop the plywood up to that angle. For instance, if you want a 45\u00b0 angle, the piece you cut for the back would need to be taller than if you wanted a 30\u00ad\u00b0 angle. Screw down from the front part of the plywood into the back brace. Use at least 1 screw on each end to hold it in place.\n4. Brace the jig against a piece of clamped wood. Clamp a long piece of wood to the back of the drill press plate. Attach c-clamps on each end. Now you can push the jig up against this piece of wood so it doesn't slide around.\n5. Drill your holes into your project. Place your project piece on the jig up against the fence. Bring the drill down and drill holes into the piece where you need them. If your piece is moving around too much, clamp it into place against the fence. Now you can drill the same angle each time with precision.\n6. Adjust the jig as needed. You don't need to make a new jig for each angle you need. Rather, just add an extra piece of wood to the back brace to extend the length. Overlap the 2 pieces of wood, and tightly clamp them into place on each end. Measure to see if you have the angle you need by placing a speed square alongside it. If you don't have the correct angle, unclamp the extra piece of wood. Adjust the wood and clamp it back into place.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":638}

{"conversations":["So, students in Gryffindor are supposed to represent bravery. How does Neville represent bravery, to the point in being accepted into the house. I've always thought of his strongest traits being things like loyalty, willingness to work hard, etc, and these things would tend to put him in Hufflepuff. ","First of all, in the first 4 years, it isn't really shown that Neville is NOT brave - the only thing he's really afraid of is his Grandmother and maybe Snape during Potions. With good reason. :)\nYou may be confusing a lack of confidence\/assertiveness with not being brave, but they are not the same (for a good in-universe illustration of the opposite, think Prof. Lockhart).\nFirst four books, he's clumsy, and is not yet showing any magical talent.\nStarting with the fifth year, Neville is shown to have been changed, and repeatedly proves his bravery and willingness to fight.\nNOTE: He first shows bravery in the First Year (see System's great answer for details), but the real Gryffindor-y Neville emerges in the Fifth year.\nThere's another instance of him showing a Gryffindor quality - more specifically, integrity. He argued with the Hat to sort him into Hufflepuff (src: Pottermore), because he felt he wasn't brave enough to be a Gryffindor.\n\nFifth year\n\n* He joins DA\n\n* He shows marked and significant improvement in his magical abilities while in DA\n\n* He voluntarily joins the DA members who accompany Harry to Ministry of Magic battle in the end of OoP, even arguing with Harry about it:\n\nNeville: &quot;We were all in the D.A. together. It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn't it? And this is the first chance we've had to do something real \u2014 or was that all just a game or something?&quot;\nHarry: &quot;No \u2014 of course it wasn't \u2014&quot;\nNeville: &quot;Then we should come too. We want to help.&quot;\n\n\n* During the battle at the Ministry, he refused to leave as per Harry's suggestion after Dolohov broke Neville's nose and wand.\n\n* When being threatened and tortured by Death Eaters, he told Harry not to give them the Prophecy\n\n\nSixth year\n\n* participated in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Along with Luna Lovegood, he was the only member of Dumbledore's Army to reply to the summons via the coins.\n\n\nSeventh year\n\n* Neville got in trouble with the Carrows for refusing to practise the Cruciatus Curse on other students as a method of punishment, as well as for standing up against their bigotry and cruelty.\n\n* along with Ginny and Luna, restarted Dumbledore's Army.\n\n* attempted to steal Godric Gryffindor's Sword from Snape's office\n\n* Neville was eventually left alone to lead the rebellion efforts (Luna and Ginny were not in Hogwarts anymore). When avoiding the Death Eaters at one point, Neville stumbled into the Room of Requirement, which he was able to turn into a hiding place for the D.A., and to connect to the Hog's Head in order to get food from Aberforth Dumbledore. By May, most of the D.A. had taken to living there.\n\n* During the first round of battle, Neville used various plants to attack Death Eaters, and helped transport the injured and dead when a temporary cease-fire was called.\n\n* When the Death Eaters approached with a &quot;dead&quot; Harry, Neville stood up in defiance of Voldemort. He was subsequently forced to wear the Sorting Hat as it burned because he refused to join Voldemort. Fortunately, due to Harry's sacrifice, Neville was able to shrug off the Full Body-Bind Curse.\n\n* Because of his tremendous bravery shown on the battlefield, Neville was able to pull Godric Gryffindor's Sword from the burning hat, in the process proving himself a true Gryffindor, something that was doubted constantly throughout due to his apparently weak-willed, shy, and bumbling nature.

Will this create problems on the network, or just be ignored?","It depends on the router\/switch. \nIf it's \"Managed\" - Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports. \n(I've only described the STP re-convergence as \"absolute insanity\" because if you're using old-style, slow, STP then re-convergence can take 30s or more, depending on network complexity.  Vendor specific STP extensions such as BackboneFast and so on will decrease this, but you might still end up with a short period of a slightly unstable network. Rapid STP is a lot quicker to converge, due to a different algorithm)\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  \nThe reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.  This is known as a \"Broadcast Storm\".\nThis can quickly use up all of a switch's CPU power, fill the transmit and receive buffers, as well as polluting the MAC address table.\nBasically, if you create a loop in the network, you'll know about it, either through monitoring (detecting a change in the STP topology [you do have monitoring, right?]), or in everything falling over dramatically.   \nIf you look at a switch that has a broadcast storm on it, you tend to find that all of the port activity lights are blinking all at the same time."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":136}

{"conversations":["How to be in a relationship without your parents knowing?","Do you have a relationship you want to hide from your parents? Are your parents unreasonable, abusive, or just a bit too conservative? Whether you\u2019re keeping it a secret because you\u2019re too young or because your parents won\u2019t approve due to their values, hiding your relationship can be challenging. While you could risk losing your parents' trust if they ever find out, you don't want to put yourself in harm's way or compromise your values. Communication, honesty, and trust are essential to any relationship, but sometimes you need to be less than truthful for your own mental and physical health.\n\n## Examine why you should hide your relationship\n\n1. Evaluate your priorities. Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship with your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval? While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth to you. Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction. If you just don't think the relationship is serious enough yet and don't wish your parents to make a big deal of it, some of the following instructions may be excessive. Consider how your parents may feel if you exaggerated the need for secrecy; they may feel disappointed and wonder why don't you trust them. Take risks prevention if you really go ahead. For example, think about what would you do if you are caught by your parents, think about what would you do if your parents know you are owning a separate social media account\/secret cell phone that makes use to communicate with your partner, think about what would you do if your dating relationship goes wrong, think about what would you do if you broke up, etc. Consider whether these risks\/consequences are affordable. It is recommended to be honest if you are getting caught. Once you get caught, more lies would only make you get into greater trouble, damaging a family relationship. As for dating relationship goes wrong or challenges comes, you will need great mental and physical quality to afford it without any support from your parents.\n2. Communicate with your partner. If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be. Your partner may have a valid argument if he or she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. He or she may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress. Your partner may also misunderstand the situation. Some people expect to be introduced at the start of a serious relationship, some are cool with waiting, and some do not wish to be introduced for quite some time.\n3. Consider the opinions of your parents. It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about, but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval. Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.\n4. Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option. Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner. Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship conflict with your parents\u2019 beliefs? If your parents\u2019 disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.\n\n\n## Overcome overbear parent\n\n1. Be mature. Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all the rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents' trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.\n2. Understand the risks of premarital sex. Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared, and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an STD, your parents may not be there to support you or just can't help you (e.g., they can help you with bringing up a child to some extent, if they wish to do so; they can't cure HIV).You may not agree with your parents rules, but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe. Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship, but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you must respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.\n3. Avoid PDA moments. Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret. Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out, they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.\n4. Buy one new cell phone secretly. If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you in concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, you may put a password in your original cell phone and computer if FEASIBLE. However, it is not advised to do so. Putting or changing a password on shared computer\/ cell phone may get suspicious, even some parents may ask you to unlock\/undo the password set when they check your phone or use the family computer. Delete the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended. It is recommended to delete partly instead of all messages because you may get suspicious if the messaging history is blank. It is best to use Incognito mode on a browser when you are online. Otherwise, erase browsing history after you have been online. However, erasing browsing history may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device, but if you use Incognito mode, you don't need to worry about this. In case your parents check your phone, either don\u2019t put your partner\u2019s number on your phone or use your partner\u2019s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen. However, it is best to memorize your partner's contact information in your mind and don't put any of his\/her contact information on your phone.\n5. Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages. If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account. Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a handy tool when dealing with long distance relationships.\n6. Have a cover. The trustworthy friends take two jobs: 1)Helping you on hiding the relationship and giving you advice on your relationship. They can support you on hiding the relationship such as collaborate on stories for your parents if you're on a date. Not only those friends can be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts, but they also act as an Intelligence Agency so that you can beat yourself to the punch to take prevention. For instance, you friends find out your parents would go to somewhere on someday, then you should take consideration before you want to meet with your partner. The another job of them is monitoring your relationship. You should acquire a political wisdom: The more voice, you make smarter decision. It is better to have more than one reliable friends so that you can listen to more than one voice if you have lots of resources to do this, even your friends could form a 'House'. However the biggest disadvantage is the larger social group, the greater chance of secret leakage even through they are royal. If your friends has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed his\/her advice. It\u2019s easy to think that one source is wrong, but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it\u2019s best to listen to their logic. Using them as an excuse if they don't agree to it is unfair to your friend.\n7. Hide gifts. It is best to hide all the gifts safely. It could be at the outside of your home at your trustworthy friend's home, rent storage, your partner's home, etc. It is strongly advised not to keep the gifts at your home because your parents could find these gifts easily if they are intended and diligent in scanning every corner of your house thoroughly. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.\n\n\n## Manage collateral\n\n1. Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship with anyone. Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom. Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.\n2. Use multiple social media accounts. The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents.\n3. Set up a shell email account. Not only would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info.\n4. Adjust your privacy settings on social media. All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy. You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything damaging at all.\n5. Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering. Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you. Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.\n6. Hide your emotions. If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions, so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts. For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.\n7. Keep track of what you are telling everyone. If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.\n8. Frame your partner as a platonic relationship. Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life. For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work-related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.\n9. Change your routine. Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have peace-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.\n\n\n## Deal with a difference in age\n\n1. Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner. Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap.\n2. Keep perspective. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues. A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. A big age gap if you're a minor and your partner isn't may also be illegal. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.\n3. Understand any power dynamics. If your partner is your professor or boss, it\u2019s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions. Understand that being in a teacher-pupil relationship can get the teacher fired and, depending on your age, even jailed. This is one relationship that is better to be put on hold - for both of you. If you truly love each other, you can wait until both of you are adults, and you have graduated.\n\n\n## Deal with your parents\u2019 different value\n\n1. Surround yourself with supportive people. If you must hide your relationship because of a difference in values -- whether religious or cultural -- seek the help of people who have been in similar situations. Bide time to help your parents and\/or partner adjust to the situation. By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents\u2019 closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change.\n2. Support your partner. Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don\u2019t agree with your parents but don\u2019t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won\u2019t hurt your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent\u2019s approval and that the secrecy is temporary. You don\u2019t need to put a time limit, but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.\n3. Don\u2019t take a side. This isn\u2019t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life. Be strong in your own values and communicate respectfully that you are unwilling to compromise that. Hiding your relationship should not be permanent. It may take time for your parents to realize that only you know what\u2019s best for you. If it means losing your parents, that is for them to decide. Being true to yourself is what's most important for your mental, emotional and physical health.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":601}

{"conversations":["I find that the survivability and general performance of my party increases massively from levels 1 to 2. At times, level 1 feels like a completely different game from level 2. However, I can't fathom how or why. I think that the availability of healing has something to do with it. From a mechanical perspective, is there any deep reason why level 1 and level 2 seem so radically different? Furthermore, why I do find no similar differences between later levels, such as 6 and 7?","Welcome to Rusty Dagger Shanktown!\nWhat you have noticed is very widely commented upon\u20141st level is often called \u201crusty dagger shanktown.\u201d It\u2019s hyper-lethal, rather than the kind of heroic fantasy Dungeons & Dragons pitches itself as. It is very, very difficult for 1st-level PCs to actually really adventure at all. Many, many groups avoid 1st for this reason (many skip 2nd too, even though it is already dramatically different). Personally, I\u2019ll include 1st level often, but the PCs basically always level-up to 2nd almost entirely on roleplaying XP.\nNote that this isn\u2019t unique to 3.5e; it goes back to the earliest days of D&D. Pathfinder, of course, inherited it from 3.5e (I don\u2019t know about PF 2e). It\u2019s also very much still true in 5e\u2014after 4e actually managed to avoid it, which may mean that this is considered a \u201cfeature\u201d by some, enough that Wizards of the Coast felt the need to restore it as part of 5e\u2019s general \u201creturn to form\u201d after the divisive fourth edition.\nAnyway, the primary causes of rusty dagger shanktown:\nHit points\nAlmost anyone can one-shot almost any 1st-level character. It\u2019s very, very easy to have 6 hp in a world where a decent, but basic, weapon\u2019s base damage averages 7. Even smaller weapons can easily deal that much damage, either through luck or skill. We expect 1st-level characters to often go down in one hit.\nA 2nd-level character can have nearly twice as much hp. Actually, could easily be twice as much, if they multiclass from a small-HD class to a large-HD class. That drastically changes the game, because suddenly you can feel reasonably confident that you aren\u2019t going to just suddenly die before anyone can do anything. Healing actually becomes relevant, where at 1st it\u2019s often too little, too late.\nNotably, this only has this effect because damage doesn\u2019t grow at the same rate. The base damage of weapons is fixed, and ability scores start at double digits but grow very slowly from there. That\u2019s the biggest chunk of early damage for most characters. Even beyond that, a lot of damage boosts\u2014inspire courage, rage, sneak attack\u2014come at 1st anyway. And monsters tend to kind of mirror these trends.\nSo what ends up happening is that a 1st-level character can\u2019t really take a chance in order to get something accomplished. A 2nd-level character can feel reasonably comfortable taking a chance at least once. That dramatically affects the style of play. At 2nd-level D&D literally feels like a different game. Really, it is a different game.\nWealth\nCharacters start with less than 200 gp worth of gear. That\u2019s not enough for a masterwork weapon, not enough even for non-masterwork medium or heavy armors, definitely not enough for any kind of magic item beyond maybe an extremely basic consumable. No 1st-level character has even their complete basic kit yet.\nThe expected wealth of a 2nd-level character is 900 gp. That can afford masterwork armor of anything short of full-plate, and for many armors leave enough left over for a masterwork weapon. Most importantly, that is enough money for a party of 4 to trivially afford a wand of cure light wounds. A wand of cure light wounds is a game-changer. It means you can easily start every fight at full hp. And with 2nd-level hp, that means you can actually take a few risks.\n2nd-level features\nThis varies considerably from one class to the next, but several classes get major class features at 2nd level. The paladin\u2019s 2nd-level feature, divine grace, might be the single greatest class feature in the game (assuming we don\u2019t count \u201cspells\u201d and the like as a singular feature). Rangers don\u2019t get their combat style until 2nd. Bards get 1st-level spells at 2nd (though inspire courage from 1st level is probably more important). Outside of core, meldshapers don\u2019t get any chakra binds until 2nd, which can leave them with zero offense at 1st. Swordsages don\u2019t get Wis-to-AC until 2nd.\nBut plenty of characters are fine from 1st, so this can vary a lot."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":141}

In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy."],"source":"authors","idx":467}

{"conversations":["How to survive an earthquake?","## Take cover indoors\n\n1. Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, if possible. In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, try to quickly move away from anything that could fall and injure you. Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter. Remember the phrase \u201cDrop, Cover, Hold on,\u201d which is the course of action recommended by U.S. and international emergency management organizations.\n2. Drop to your hands and knees under a sturdy table or desk. Look for a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a solid table, that can offer cover from falling objects. Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This is was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner. A doorway doesn't offer much protection from falling or flying objects, which cause the most earthquake-related injuries and deaths.\n3. Protect your head and neck from falling debris. If possible, grab a pillow, sofa cushion, or another object to shield your face and head. If there's nothing nearby to use as a shield, cover your face, head, and neck with your hands and arms. A strong earthquake can kick up clouds of dangerous dust. If this is the case, you should also cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief or an article of clothing.\n4. Remain in your safe spot until the shaking stops. Stay put until the shaking has stopped for 1 or 2 minutes. Remain on guard when you get up, as aftershocks can occur at any time after an earthquake. In the event of an earthquake, you and your family (or coworkers, if you're at work) should meet in a designated safe location. Create an action plan in advance, and head to the designated meeting place once the shaking has stopped. If an aftershock occurs, drop, cover, and hold on until it stops.\n5. Use caution around debris after leaving your shelter. Watch out for broken glass and rubble. If you're not wearing shoes, tread lightly, and be extremely careful not to injure yourself. Grab a pair of heavy-soled shoes and, if you're wearing light clothing, put on a pair of pants and a long-sleeved shirt. In a strong earthquake, remember to cover your mouth to avoid inhaling dust, especially if you have a history of any respiratory diseases. If you're trapped, don't shout, as you'd risk inhaling dust. Instead, send a text or call emergency services, tap on a hard surface, or, if you have one, blow a whistle to alert first responders of your location.\n6. Check for injuries and render aid, if needed. Call emergency services if you or someone nearby are injured and need medical attention. If you know first aid or CPR, administer emergency care as needed. To perform CPR, place one hand over the center of the person's chest, and hold your other hand over the first. Keep your arms straight as you press directly into their chest at a rate of about 100 beats per minute. Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound. Pack the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth and apply firm pressure. If firm pressure doesn't stop the bleeding, use a belt, article of clothing, or bandages to fashion a tourniquet. Wrap the tourniquet 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above the wound toward the torso. For a wound on the thigh, wrap the tourniquet above the wound near the groin to limit the amount of blood flowing from the heart. If someone is seriously injured or unconscious, don't move them unless the building is structurally unsound or they're otherwise in immediate danger.\n7. Inspect the building for structural damage and hazards. Check for cracks in the building's structure, fires, the smell of gas, and damaged wires or electrical appliances. If you believe the building is unsound, evacuate immediately. If possible, and if there's no immediate threat that the building will collapse, respond to any utility hazards. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the main valve outside and call the gas company. Note that a professional will be needed to restore service. Look for signs of electrical damage, including sparks, broken or frayed wires, and burning smells. If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you'd have to step in water to access the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician instead of approaching it yourself. Put out any small fires with a fire extinguisher. If there's a larger fire, call emergency services. Evacuate immediately if there's a fire and you smell gas. Don't drink water from the sink, bathe, or use the toilet until your local authorities have advised that it's safe to do so. Plug the drains in sinks and bathtubs to prevent sewage backflow.\n\n\n## Rid it out in a vehicle\n\n1. Stop in a clear area away from trees, buildings, and other structures. Find an open area and stop your vehicle on the shoulder or side of the road. Get as far away as you can from utility poles, large structures, bridges, and any other potential hazards. Pay attention to surrounding traffic, and stop only when it's safe to do so. Don't stop abruptly, or vehicles to the rear might collide with you.\n2. Set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. The car may jiggle violently during an earthquake, but stay put and try to remain calm. You're safer in a car than outside, since vehicles offer protection from debris and falling objects. Turn on your radio, as channels should be broadcasting emergency broadcast information.\n3. Beware of damaged roads, debris, and other hazards when you continue driving. Listen for reports of road closures or hazards on the emergency broadcast. When the shaking stops, resume driving and keep your eye out for damaged roadways, sinkholes, unsound bridges, and any other potential hazards. If a power line has fallen on your vehicle or you're otherwise unable to travel, stay put. Call emergency services, and wait for first responders.\n\n\n## Stay safe outdoors\n\n1. Move away from buildings, street lights, power lines, and bridges. The most dangerous locations during an earthquake are areas immediately around buildings. As soon as the ground begins shaking, try to get as far away as possible from any nearby structures. Stay low to the ground to keep your balance as you get to a safe spot, and keep your eye out for falling debris. Do not seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. Additionally, look out for sinkholes, open faults, or large holes in the ground.\n2. Crouch down low in a wide open area until the shaking stops. Once you've made your way away from nearby structures, get on your hands and knees and cover your head. See if there are any objects nearby to use as a shield, such as a trash can lid. If none are available, cover your head and neck with your hands and arms. Remain crouched low to the ground in a covered position until the shaking stops.\n3. Watch out for hazards as you assess your surroundings. As you venture out after the earthquake, beware of broken glass, rubble, downed power lines, fallen trees, and any other potential hazards. Check yourself and anyone nearby for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid and call emergency services. Stay away from damaged structures and areas immediately around buildings. Remember that aftershocks may occur. If there's an aftershock, weakened buildings, windows, and architectural details can fall to the ground.\n4. Get to higher ground if you're on the shore or near a dam. If a shaking lasts more than 20 seconds, don't wait for an alarm or warning to flee. Get to ground that's at least 100 ft (30 m) above sea level or 2 mi (3.2 km) from the shore. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, so put distance between yourself and the coast. While a catastrophic failure is unlikely, earthquake damage can cause flooding downstream from a dam. If you live in a flood zone, proceed to higher ground. Check evacuation plans in advance if you live near a dam in an earthquake-prone area.\n\n\n## Prepare for an earthquake\n\n1. Make an emergency supply kit. Keep your supplies in an easily accessible spot, such as a hall closet or garage. Make sure every member of your family knows where your emergency supplies are located. Keep the following items on hand:\n\t* Enough bottled water and non-perishable food to last 3 days. A first aid kit, including gauze, alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, tweezers, ibuprofen or another pain reliever, cotton swabs, anti-diarrhea medication, sanitary napkins, and eyewash. Medications that any members of your family take regularly. A flashlight and extra batteries. Tools, including a screwdriver and adjustable wrench. A whistle, to alert first responders in the event you become trapped. Clothes and blankets. Your pet's food and medication, if you have one.\n2. Create a family survival plan for your home. You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety in the event of an emergency. Instruct every member of your household to drop, cover, and hold on, then to head to a designated meeting location when the shaking stops. Designated spots might be a clearing near your home, a school, community center, or a shelter. Make a plan to reunite ahead of time, as phone service may be limited and should be used only for emergencies. Conduct practice drills every 6 months to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.\n3. Identify safe spots and hazards in each room of your home. Look for tall cabinets, televisions, dressers, bookcases, hanging plants, and other objects that could fall and cause injury. Go room by room with your family members, and note spots that offer protection and those that are potentially dangerous. For example, if there's a heavy desk in your child's bedroom, tell them to take cover under it. Advise them to stay away from their windows and dresser.\n4. Store dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves. Avoid storing heavy objects high up, and install brackets to secure tall furniture to walls. Keep any dangerous items, such as sharp objects, glass, and flammable or toxic substances in locked or low cabinets. Objects such as knives or corrosive liquids can cause serious injury, especially if they fall from a high storage spot during an earthquake.\n5. Take first-aid and CPR classes to become certified. If someone nearby is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a lifesaver. A CPR certification will prepare you to respond if the worst happens. Look online for nearby classes, or check with a local clinic or Red Cross chapter.\n6. Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity, and the gas. Earthquakes can damage utilities and cause flooding, fires, or explosions. If you're not sure how to shut off your utilities, call your service providers for specific instructions. To shut off electricity, turn off individual circuits or fuses at the main box, then turn off the main circuit or fuse. Your gas main should be near your gas meter, but locations vary. Use an adjustable wrench to turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise. Your water main should be at your water meter by the street or sidewalk, but it may be inside your home. Turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise to shut off your water.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":708}

{"conversations":["What is the LXX and why is it so noteworthy that there is a Greek translation of the OT? Wouldn't it be better to directly reference manuscripts in the original languages?","Before 1947, a good case could be made that the Septuagint represented a more ancient tradition than the Masoretic versions of the Tanakh.  Since the Septuagint was produced before 132 BCE (and probably in the 3rd century BCE) and the earliest known Masoretic manuscripts date to the 10th century CE, the Greek translation might have fossilized an early rendering of the Scriptures while the Hebrew continued to be copied and potentially altered.  To further support the primacy of the Septuagint, the early Christian and Hellenistic Jewish texts, tended to use that translation rather go back to Hebrew sources.\nAn interesting counter-argument arises from the observation that during the 600 years from Jerome's translation into Latin (the Vulgate) to the earliest Masoretic manuscripts, the Hebrew seems to have been faithfully copied.  That suggests that Jewish scribes were exceptionally careful to duplicate their scriptures.\nAfter 1947, the evidence changed.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n  [Most] of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\".\n\nAnother another article describes the meaning of the categories in detail.\nA few caveats are in order:\n\n* Surveying the Qumran about religious texts seems something akin to surveying a hippie commune about political issues&mdash;you're likely to experience some bias.  If we could obtain a similar collection from Jerusalem, we'd likely find more agreement and likely the side of MT.  Given the diversity in non-Scriptural texts, 60% seems quite solid support.\n* While it's unlikely, there exists a chronological possibility the scrolls associated with the Septuagint-aligned Hebrew were influenced by the Greek.  (Any references one way or the other would be appreciated.) \n\nWhat remains therefore is a window into the community of Alexandrian Jews that produced the translation.  For those who are interested in the development of Jewish belief, that can be extremely useful.  N. T. Wright's book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, shows that the LXX translators chose to interpret key texts from Daniel and Ezekiel about the resurrection as literal rather than metaphorical.  He argues from this that belief in bodily resurrection was more common in Jesus' day than other scholars assert."],"source":"stackexchange","idx":113}

{"conversations":["How to respond to unsolicited advice?","When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It\u2019s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn\u2019t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won\u2019t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn\u2019t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, \u201cI often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don\u2019t trust me to help myself,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.\u201d\n3.

{"conversations":["If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection, like in the following example:\n```$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input'];\nmysql_query(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')\");\n```\nThat's because the user can input something like ```value'); DROP TABLE table;--```, and the query becomes:\n```INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')\n```\nWhat can be done to prevent this from happening?","The correct way to avoid SQL injection attacks, no matter which database you use, is to separate the data from SQL, so that data stays data and will never be interpreted as commands by the SQL parser. It is possible to create an SQL statement with correctly formatted data parts, but if you don't fully understand the details, you should always use prepared statements and parameterized queries. These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\nYou basically have two options to achieve this:\n\n1. Using PDO (for any supported database driver):\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n$stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    \/\/ Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\n2. Using MySQLi (for MySQL):\nSince PHP 8.2+ we can make use of execute_query() which prepares, binds parameters, and executes SQL statement in one method:\n```\n$result = $dbConnection->execute_query('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?', [$name]);\n\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    \/\/ Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\nUp to PHP8.1:\n```\n$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $name); \/\/ 's' specifies the variable type => 'string'\n$stmt->execute();\n\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    \/\/ Do something with $row\n}\n```\nIf you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (for example, pg_prepare() and pg_execute() for PostgreSQL).

{"conversations":["How to make felt?","Felting is fun no matter what your age. Once you learn the process of felting, you can let your imagination be your guide and move on to other, more complex shapes. Felt sheets are the most basic, but felt balls can be just as fun to make.When you are done, you can turn your handmade felt into pretty patches or beaded garlands!\n\n## Make a felt sheet\n\n1. Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts. Do not cut the wool into tufts. This will create sharp edges and make it difficult to felt. Also, be sure to get pure wool and not acrylic; acrylic fibers will not felt. Many crafters will recommend Merino wool for its fine fibers. The wool does not have to be naturally colored! Consider getting some dyed wool!\n2. Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish. Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty.\n3. Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one. For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result.\n4. Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet. Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer. Two layers is perfectly fine for a thin piece of felt, but if you'd like something thicker, aim for three or four layers total. Consider adding some pieces of loose-weave fabric or bits of Merino yarn on top for color and texture.\n5. Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric. This will help keep the fibers in place during the felting process. The fabric needs to be big enough to cover the entire wool sheet.\n6. Make your felting solution and pour it into a spray bottle. Keep the rest of the felting solution handy to refill the bottle as needed. You will need 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1 quart (950 milliliters) of hot water. Don't shake the bottle, or you will create too many suds. The hotter the water is, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that it is uncomfortable to work with, however.\n7. Spray the wool down, then gently massage it with a piece of soapy bubble wrap. Don't be tempted to pour the water onto the wool. This will cause the fibers to move around too much. Instead, spray it down with your hot, soapy water until it is completely saturated (but not dripping). Ball up some bubble wrap, rub it over a piece of bar soap, then gently massage the felt using small, circular motions. If you accidentally soaked the wool, use a small sponge to mop up the excess water.\n8. Continue pressing on the wool until the fibers come together. Pour the water off as it cools, and spray more hot, soapy water onto it. Be sure to tuck in any loose or stray fibers as you work. This will make the edges of your sheet a little more even.\n9. When the wool is ready, transfer it to a sheet of bubble wrap and peel off the tulle or polyester fabric. You can tell if the wool is ready by doing a simple pinch test. Pinch a piece of the wool between your thumb and forefinger. If it stays in place and doesn't come off, you can move on the to the next step. If it lifts away, then continue pressing the wool. The bubble wrap needs to be textured side up.\n10. Roll up the bubble wrap tightly. Start by folding an inch (2.54 centimeters) of so of bubble wrap over the bottom edge of the felted wool to create a seam. Next, roll the wool up as tightly as you can along with the bubble wrap, starting from the bottom. Press down as you roll the wool to drain off any excess water.\n11. Roll the bubble wrap tube across a flat surface for about five minutes. Roll it gently at first, then with increasing pressure later on. Don't over-felt or over-work your wool.\n12. Rinse the sheet with cold water, then squeeze it to drain off the excess water. The cold water rinse will help set the fibers. Gently press down onto the felt sheet to squeeze out the excess water. Do not wring or twist it. Consider adding a splash of white vinegar to the water. This will remove excess soap and restore the natural pH of the wool; it will brighten the wool's colors and help it last longer.\n13. Lay the wool out some place flat to dry. The wool will have shrunk and thickened during the felting process. It may also shrink a little bit more while it dries. This is completely natural.\n14. Use your felted wool. You can cut it into squares and sew it onto a bag to make patches. You can also cut it into circles to make coasters. The possibilities are endless!\n\n\n## Make felt ball\n\n1. Pull apart some raw wool into tufts. Do not cut the tufts. If you cut them, you will get sharp edges that will be harder to felt. You can use natural, uncolored wool, or wool that has been dyed bright colors. The size of the tufts doesn't really matter, but a 4 to 5-inch long (10 to 12 centimeters) tuft will give you a bead about the size of a cherry.\n2. Fill a small tub with hot water and add some liquid dish soap into it. You will need 2 tablespoons of dish soap for every 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Gently swish the water to mix, but not so much to create suds. The hotter the water, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that you can't handle it, however.\n3. Gather a few tufts into a ball, then roll them between your palms. Don't worry about forming a firm ball just yet. You can use all one color of wool, or several different colors for a more interesting felt ball.\n4. Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water. Hold the ball between your fingers, then dip it into the hot, soapy water. Don't worry if the ball starts to lose its shape and sag. You will reshape it in the next step.\n5. Roll the ball between your palms until it becomes firm. The ball will be loose at first, but then it will start to become more firm. This will take about 10 minutes. Be careful not to squeeze it too much. If you are making multiple beads, the water may cool down while you work. When that happens, replace the tub with more hot, soapy water.\n6. When the wool is firm, rinse it off with cold water. This will get rid of the soap and help set the fibers. If you'd like, you can then soak it in some water with a splash of white vinegar in it. This will help remove the rest of the soap and brighten the wool's color.\n7. Gently press the ball in a towel to remove excess water. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, of you may distort the ball.\n8. Allow the felt ball to air dry. This will take about 24 hours. Remember, just because the ball is dry on the outside does not necessarily mean that it is dry on the inside.\n9. Consider threading the balls onto some twine to make a garland. Poke a hole through each ball using a darning needle, and pull some heavy thread through it. You may need to use needle nose pliers to help pull the needle through, especially of the felt balls are firm. Hang the garland wherever you like when you are done.\n"],"source":"wikihow","idx":696}

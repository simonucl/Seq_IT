Add a suffix task. \nEnsure that the newly added task will either help the answering for original instruction or sequentially follow the instruction's answer.\nThis is the original instruction: “Describe the structure of an atom.”\nSo what is the option you choose and new instruction?  Please answer me by replying in the format of \"Option: , Instruction:\". After that, give answer with the generated instruction and input (if have), with clear separation between answering the first and second part of instruction.\n\nOption: 1, Instruction: First, describe the structure of an atom. Then, explain how electrons contribute to chemical bonding.\nDescribe the structure of an atom:\nAn atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. It is composed of three main types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons form the atom's nucleus at the center, with protons carrying a positive charge and neutrons being neutral. Electrons, which carry a negative charge, orbit the nucleus in electron shells. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the element's atomic number, and the combination of protons and neutrons gives the atom its mass. Electrons play a crucial role in chemical reactions and bonding, as they can be shared between atoms or transferred from one atom to another.\nExplain how electrons contribute to chemical bonding:\nElectrons contribute to chemical bonding through two primary mechanisms: ionic and covalent bonding. In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) which are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges. This type of bond is typically formed between metals and nonmetals. In covalent bonding, electrons are shared between atoms, allowing each atom to attain a stable electron configuration. This sharing can involve equal sharing (nonpolar covalent bonding) or unequal sharing (polar covalent bonding) of electrons. Electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, are particularly important in bonding as they determine the chemical reactivity and bonding capacity of an atom.\n\nGiven the original instruction, you should propose a new instruction based on it by doing one of following things:\n1.

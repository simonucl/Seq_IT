The review included 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria and found that robotics had a positive impact on patient outcomes, such as reduced hospital stays and improved patient satisfaction. The review also found that robotics improved healthcare provider performance, including reduced fatigue and improved accuracy. However, the review noted that the evidence was limited by the heterogeneity of the studies and the need for further research.\n\nMethodologies: The review used a systematic search strategy to identify relevant studies, including a search of major databases such as PubMed and Scopus. The inclusion criteria included studies that investigated the effects of robotics on healthcare outcomes, and the exclusion criteria included studies that were not published in English or did not provide sufficient data.\n\nSignificant implications for the healthcare system:\n\n* The use of robotics in healthcare can improve patient outcomes, including reduced hospital stays and improved patient satisfaction.\n* Robotics can improve healthcare provider performance, including reduced fatigue and improved accuracy.\n* The evidence suggests that robotics can be a valuable tool in the healthcare system, but further research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\nCitation: Lee, J.

The similarities highlight the shared values and principles that underlie both documents, while the differences reflect the distinct purposes and contexts in which they were written.

Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).'],\n",

The number of protons in the nucleus determines the element\\'s atomic number, and the combination of protons and neutrons gives the atom its mass. Electrons play a crucial role in chemical reactions and bonding, as they can be shared between atoms or transferred from one atom to another.\\nExplain how electrons contribute to chemical bonding:\\nElectrons contribute to chemical bonding through two primary mechanisms: ionic and covalent bonding. In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) which are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges. This type of bond is typically formed between metals and nonmetals. In covalent bonding, electrons are shared between atoms, allowing each atom to attain a stable electron configuration. This sharing can involve equal sharing (nonpolar covalent bonding) or unequal sharing (polar covalent bonding) of electrons. Electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, are particularly important in bonding as they determine the chemical reactivity and bonding capacity of an atom.\\n\\nGiven the original instruction, you should propose a new instruction based on it by doing one of following things:\\n1. Decompose it into two tasks.\\n2. Add a prefix task.\\n3. Add a suffix task. \\nEnsure that the newly added task will either help the answering for original instruction or sequentially follow the instruction\\'s answer.\\nThis is the original instruction: “Identify the fallacy used in the following statement.\\nOutput should be a single word.” And this is the original input: “We should not accept the refugees from Syria because they are likely to steal from us.”\\nSo what is the option you choose and new instruction?  Please answer me by replying in the format of \"Option: , Instruction:\". After that, give answer with the generated instruction and input (if have), with clear separation between answering the first and second part of instruction.\\n\\nOption: 3, Instruction: List four reasons why it would be beneficial to take a gap year, and afterwards, evaluate how each reason could impact your personal growth and career trajectory.\\nList four reasons why it would be beneficial to take a gap year:\\nTaking a gap year, a break typically taken between high school and college or during undergraduate studies, can offer numerous benefits for personal growth and career trajectory. Here are four reasons why a gap year can be beneficial:\\n1. Exposure to Different Cultures and Perspectives\\n2. Improved Academic Focus\\n3. Development of Life Skills\\n4. Enhanced Resume and Network\\nEvaluate how each reason could impact your personal growth and career trajectory:\\n1. Exposure to Different Cultures and Perspectives\\nImpact on Personal Growth: Developing a global perspective can transform your worldview, making you more open-minded and adaptable. These qualities are invaluable in personal relationships and in navigating life\\'s challenges.\\nImpact on Career Trajectory: Employers value candidates with international experience and the ability to work effectively in diverse teams. Your broadened perspectives can make you a more attractive job candidate and can lead to opportunities in international fields or organizations.\\n2. Improved Academic Focus\\nImpact on Personal Growth: Taking time to understand your interests and goals can lead to a more fulfilling academic and professional life. This self-awareness is a key component of personal development.\\nImpact on Career Trajectory: With a clearer understanding of your academic and career objectives, you\\'re more likely to pursue and excel in fields that genuinely interest you, leading to a more satisfying and potentially successful career.\\n3. Development of Life Skills\\nImpact on Personal Growth: Mastering these life skills can increase your independence and confidence. These traits are beneficial in both personal and professional contexts, enhancing your ability to manage challenges.\\nImpact on Career Trajectory: Employers look for candidates with strong life skills, as they are indicative of someone who is reliable and can handle responsibility. These skills can give you an edge in the job market and are often transferable across different roles and industries.\\n4. Enhanced Resume and Network\\nImpact on Personal Growth: Building a diverse network can expand your horizons and offer support in both personal and professional ventures. The experiences you gain can also boost your self-esteem and communication skills.\\nImpact on Career Trajectory: A standout resume with unique experiences and a broad network can open doors to job opportunities. Networking can lead to career advancements and insights into different industries, potentially speeding up your career progression.\\n\\n\\nGiven the original instruction, you should propose a new instruction based on it by doing one of following things:\\n1.

       " 'output': 'The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).'}"

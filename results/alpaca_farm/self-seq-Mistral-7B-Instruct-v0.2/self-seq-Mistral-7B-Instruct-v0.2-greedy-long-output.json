Hildibrand Manderville once again became a gentlemanly wizard, while Nashu continued his warrior's journey to protect the kingdom from any threats that may arise.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Gandalf the Grey and his quest to regain his original form ends, a testament to the power of friendship, courage, and the magic of the enchanted realm of Eldoria.", "generator": "self-seq-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-greedy-long", "dataset": "koala"}

It allows developers to specify the data type of a variable, ensuring that the compiler catches any errors during compilation. Duck Typing, on the other hand, is a type system that uses a specific pattern of errors to indicate the type of data that a variable can hold. In Duck Typing, the compiler generates an error message that guides the programmer on the correct data type to use. Both TypeScript and Duck Typing help developers write code with strong type checking and improve the quality of their programs.", "generator": "self-seq-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-greedy-long", "dataset": "koala"}

{"instruction": "explain what the theory of sexual selection is and give an example.", "output": "Explain what the theory of sexual selection is:\nThe theory of sexual selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, states that organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than those that are less adapted. This leads to the gradual change of populations over time as advantageous traits become more common.\n\nGive an example:\nAn example of the theory of sexual selection in action is the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution in England. Prior to the widespread pollution from factories, the light-colored peppered moth was well-camouflaged against the lichen-covered trees. However, as industrial pollution darkened the tree trunks, the darker variant of the moth became more prevalent as it was better camouflaged against the soot-covered trees. This shift in the moth population's coloration is a result of sexual selection favoring the better-camouflaged individuals, illustrating how environmental changes can drive evolutionary adaptations through sexual selection.", "generator": "self-seq-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-greedy-long", "dataset": "oasst"}

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "output": "Summarize the article:\nThe article discusses the relationship between mathematics and art, highlighting how mathematical principles have influenced artistic expression for centuries.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models", "output": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper:\nThe dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. These models utilize attention mechanisms to connect the encoder and decoder, allowing them to capture dependencies in sequential data.\n\nExplain: The Transformer model\n\nResponse:\nThe Transformer model is a type of neural network that uses attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms that allow it to capture dependencies in the input sequence. By utilizing attention, the Transformer model can effectively capture long-range dependencies in text data, making it suitable for tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis.", "generator": "self-seq-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-greedy-long", "dataset": "selfinstruct"}

{"instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "output": "Summary of the paper:\nThe paper focuses on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, highlighting the challenges of intent detection and slot filling in dialogue.

{"instruction": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "output": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases:\nVaccinations work by introducing a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen into the body, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies without causing the disease itself. This prepares the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens in the future. When a vaccinated individual is exposed to a real pathogen, their immune system can quickly recognize and neutralize it, preventing infection and the development of symptoms. Vaccinations not only protect individuals who receive them but also contribute to herd immunity, where a sufficient proportion of the population is immune to a disease, making its spread less likely.\n\nWhat is herd immunity?\nHerd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious diseases that occurs when a large percentage of a population becomes immune to the disease, either through vaccination or prior illness. When a significant portion of the population is immune, the spread of the disease is limited, as there are fewer susceptible individuals for the pathogen to infect. This not only protects those who are immune but also helps shield vulnerable individuals who cannot receive vaccinations due to medical reasons, such as infants or individuals with weakened immune systems.", "generator": "self-seq-Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-greedy-long", "dataset": "vicuna"}

If 1/3 is 5, then she sells 5/3 = 1.67 vacuum cleaners. Let's call this number x.\n2. She sells 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has x + 2 vacuum cleaners now.\n3. She sells the remaining 1/2 of the vacuum cleaners at the orange house. If the remaining number is y, then she sells y/2 vacuum cleaners.\n4. We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up an equation: x + 2 + y/2 = 5\n5. Simplify the equation: 3x + 4 = 5\n6. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 1\n7. Divide both sides: x = 1/3\n8. Find y: y/2 = 5 - 2 - 1/3 = 5/3\n9. y = 2 * 5/3 = 10/3\n10. x + 2 + y/2 = 5 is true: 1/3 + 2 + 10/3 = 5\n\nThe Answer is: 1/3 = 33.33 (since 1/3 is not a whole number, we can convert it to a decimal)", "prediction": "3"}

If she can jump 3 miles per hour, how far can she cover in 6 hours?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Diana's running speed is 4 times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 1/4 of her running speed. Her jumping speed is 1/2 of her running speed. So her walking speed is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8 of her jumping speed. If she can jump 3 miles per hour, then she can walk 3 * 1/8 = 0.375 miles per hour. In 6 hours, she can walk 0.375 * 6 = 2.25 miles. Since she runs 4 times faster than she walks, she can run 4 * 2.25 = 9 miles in 6 hours. So she can complete 9 + 2.25 = 11.25 miles in 6 hours.\nThe Answer is: 11.25 miles", "prediction": "11.25"}

How many gallons of water has the boat taken on by the time she reaches the shore?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Juliet's boat leaks 2 gallons of water for every 10 feet she rows. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she leaks 2 * 20 / 16 = 5 gallons of water in 16 seconds. In 64 seconds, she will row 64 * 10 / 16 = 40 feet, so she will leak 2 * 40 / 16 = 10 gallons of water.

Then, the total number of bicycles on the first day is 2x * 5 = 10x. On the second day, the total number of bicycles is 30. We can set up an equation: 10x + y = 30, where y is the number of containers that arrived on the second day. Solving for y, we get y = 30 - 10x.

{"question": "乔希决定试试房屋翻新。他花了 80,000 美元买了一套房子，然后投入 50,000 美元进行维修。这样做使房子的价值增加了 150%。他赚了多少利润？", "answer": 70000, "model_output": " Translation the question into English:\nQuestion: Joe decided to try house renovation. He spent 80,000 dollars buying a house and then invested 50,000 dollars in renovation. This increased the house's value by 150%. How much profit did he make?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Joe bought the house for 80,000 dollars.\n2. He invested 50,000 dollars in renovation.\n3. The house's value increased by 150%, which means it's now worth 80,000 + x dollars, where x is the increase.\n4. We know that the increase is 150% of 80,000, which is 120,000. So x = 120,000.\n5. The total cost of the house and renovation is 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.\n6. The profit is the difference between the total cost and the new value of the house. Profit = 130,000 - (80,000 + 120,000) = 130,000 - 200,000 = -70,000. But this is negative, which doesn't make sense. Let's try to find the mistake.\n\nThe mistake is in step 3. The 150% increase means the house's value is now 1.5 times the original value, not 1.5 times the original value plus some fixed amount. Let's try again:\n\n1. Joe bought the house for 80,000 dollars.\n2. He invested 50,000 dollars in renovation.\n3. The house's value increased by 150%, which means it's now worth 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000 dollars.\n4. The total cost of the house and renovation is 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.\n5. The profit is the difference between the total cost and the new value of the house. Profit = 130,000 - 120,000 = 10,000.\n\nThe Answer is: 10,000.", "prediction": "10000"}

The other pair of high heels costs 2x. The third pair of high heels costs 2x - 5. We know that the cost of the shoes Gloria found is equal to the cost of the third pair, so x = 2x - 5. Subtract 5 from both sides: x = 2x - 10. Divide both sides by 2: x = 2x - 5. This is true for both pairs of high heels.

Let's say Lara's new salary is x * 1.2 (since her salary increases by some amount, let's call it y.

Dillon was sent to buy 4 watermelons, 20 jalapenos, and 10 oranges. If each jalapeno costs 15 dollars, how much will he have to pay in total?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's say the price of jalapenos is x. Then the price of watermelons is 3x. The price of oranges is 3x - 5. Dillon needs 4 watermelons, 20 jalapenos, and 10 oranges. So he needs 4 * 3x + 20 * x + 10 * (3x - 5) = 4 * 3x + 20x + 10(3x - 5) = 4 * 3x + 20x + 30x - 50 = 54x - 50. If each jalapeno costs 15, then 20 jalapenos cost 20 * 15 = 300. So 54x - 50 = 300, 54x = 350, x = 6.5. The answer is 4 * 3(6.5) + 20(6.5) + 10(6.5 - 5) = 26.5 + 130 + 55 = 211.5.\nThe Answer is: 211.5", "prediction": "211.5"}
{"question": "一家医院每天接诊 500 人。每位患者的看诊时长平均为 24 分钟。医生对医院收费每小时 150 美元，医院对患者收费每小时 200 美元。医院从这些就诊中获得多少利润？", "answer": 10000, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe hospital sees 500 patients a day. Each patient takes 24 minutes to be seen, so the total time is 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours as 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.\n\nThe doctor charges $150 per hour, so the total amount the doctor earns is 200 hours * $150 = $30,000.\n\nThe hospital charges $200 per hour, so the total amount the hospital earns is 200 hours * $200 = $40,000.\n\nThe hospital's profit is the difference between what they earn and what they pay the doctor.

Each croissant is 4 inches long, each babka is 6 inches long, and each long bagel is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the breads end to end, how long will it be in total?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's calculate the total length of each type of bread:\n\n* Croissants: 300 * 4 = 1200 inches\n* Chocolate babka: 120 * 6 = 720 inches\n* Long bagels: 60 * 2 = 120 feet\n\nNow, let's convert the inches to feet: 1 foot = 12 inches, so 1200 inches = 100 feet, 720 inches = 60 feet, 120 feet = 10 feet.\n\nFinally, let's add up the lengths: 100 + 60 + 10 = 170 feet. Since Bill connects the breads end to end, we need to add up the lengths of the breads in the order they are made: 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches + 2 feet + 4 inches + 6 inches", "prediction": "6"}

If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much does he have left after paying all these expenses and donations?\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent, gas, and charity.\n\n1/4 of $6,000 is $1,500 (rent)\n1/3 of $6,000 is $2,000 (gas)\nThe rest is $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,600 (charity)\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Zaid has left after paying all these expenses and donations.\n\nZaid gets $6,000 per month. He spends $1,500 on rent, $2,000 on gas, and $2,600 on charity. That's a total of $1,500 + $2,000 + $2,600 = $5,100.

This gives us $10(1000 - x) = 10(500 - x/2). Simplifying, we get 1000 - x = 500 - x/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2000 - 2x = 1000 - x.

The total cost of 1/2 as many cups (i.e. 10 cups) is $x - 1200. Since each cup costs $6000, we can set up an equation:\n\n20x = 6000(20)\n10x - 1200 = 6000(10)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n20x = 120000\n10x - 1200 = 60000\n\nMultiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n20x - 2400 = 120000\n\nAdding 2400 to both sides, we get:\n\n20x = 120000 + 2400\n20x = 360000\n\nDividing both sides by 20, we get:\n\nx = 18000\n\nSo, the total cost of 1 cup is $18000.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sarah has earned $5 each time she watched her neighbor's kids 4 times. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah had $10 before she started watching the kids, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to buy the jacket and shoes?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Sarah needs $30 for the jacket and $20 each for the shoes, so she needs $30 + 20 + 20 = $70 in total. She earns $5 each time she watches the kids, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns $4 * 3 = $12. She had $10 before she started watching the kids, so now she has 10 + 20 + 12 = $42. She needs 70 - 42 = 28 more dollars. She can earn 5 dollars each time she watches the kids, so she needs 28 / 5 = 5.6 times. Since she can't earn a fraction of a dollar, she needs 6 times to earn 28 dollars. She needs to mow the lawn 6 - 3 = 3 more times.\nThe Answer is: 3", "prediction": "3"}

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each. So Jerry collects 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42 eggs. Simplifying the equation, we get 8x + 10 = 42, so 8x = 32, and x = 4.

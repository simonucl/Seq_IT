This is 25 cups/day.\n\nSo, in total, Wendy gives 3 cups/day (initially) + 15 cups/day (morning) + 25 cups/day (afternoon) = 43 cups/day.\n\nSince she has 20 chickens, she needs to give 43 cups/day to all of them.

The cost of planting a lemon tree is $90.\n2. The tree produces 7 lemons per year.\n3. Each lemon costs $1.5 to sell.\n4. The cost of watering and fertilizing the tree for 1 year is $3.\n\nTo find out how many years it takes to make a profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.\n\nTotal Revenue = Number of lemons produced per year * Price per lemon = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year\n\nTotal Cost = Initial cost of planting + Annual cost of watering and fertilizing = $90 + $3/year = $93/year\n\nSince the total revenue is less than the total cost, it will take more than 1 year to make a profit. Let's calculate the number of years it will take:\n\nYear 1: Total Cost = $93, Total Revenue = $10.5, Loss = $93 - $10.5 = $82.5\nYear 2: Total Cost = $93, Total Revenue = $10.5 + $10.5 = $21, Profit = $21 - $93 = -$72\nYear 3: Total Cost = $93, Total Revenue = $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 = $31.5, Profit = $31.5 - $93 = -$61.5\nYear 4: Total Cost = $93, Total Revenue = $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 = $42, Profit = $42 - $93 = -$51\nYear 5: Total Cost = $93, Total Revenue = $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 + $10.5 = $52.5, Profit = $52.5 - $93 = -$40.5\n\nAfter 5 years, the profit is still negative, but it's getting closer to being positive.

The total distance covered by skipping is 2 * (3 / 2) = 3 hours, and the total distance covered by walking is (1 / 2) * (3 / 2) = 3 / 4 hours.\n\nThe total distance covered in 6 hours is the sum of the distances covered by skipping and walking: 3 hours + 3 / 4 hours = 3 + 3 / 4 = 3.75 hours.\n\nSince the distance covered in 1 hour is 1 mile, the total distance covered in 6 hours is 3.75 miles.\n\nNow, we need to convert this to kilometers: 1 mile = 1.6 kilometers, so 3.75 miles = 3.75 * 1.6 = 6 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Dana covers 6 kilometers in 6 hours.", "prediction": "6"}

{"question": "トムの船は1時間に10マイル進むことができる。彼は午後1時から4時まで航海しています。それから彼は、時速6マイルで帰路に着きます。彼が戻るまでに、どれくらいかかりますか？", "answer": 5, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nTom's boat can travel at 10 miles per hour. He sailed from 1 pm to 4 pm, which means he sailed for 3 hours. In that time, he covered a distance of 10 miles per hour, so he sailed a total of 3 hours x 10 miles/hour = 30 miles.\n\nThen, he returned at 6 miles per hour, which is slower than his outward journey. To find the time it took to return, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's set up an equation: 30 miles = 6 miles/hour x time. To solve for time, we can divide both sides by 6 miles/hour: time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it took Tom 5 hours to return. In total, it took him 3 hours to sail out and 5 hours to return, making it a total of 3 + 5 = 8 hours.", "prediction": "8"}

To find the number of cars that ran for the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that entered the traffic jam from the number of cars that ran for the first 15 minutes: 15 - 60 = -45 cars.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a negative number of cars, this means that 15 cars ran for the first 15 minutes, and the remaining 15 cars ran for the next 15 minutes.\n\nThe answer is: 15 cars ran for the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.", "prediction": "15"}

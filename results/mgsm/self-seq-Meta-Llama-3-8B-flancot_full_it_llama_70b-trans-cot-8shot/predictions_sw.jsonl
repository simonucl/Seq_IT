In this time, he covers a distance of 10 miles per hour, so he covers a total distance of 10 * 3 = 30 miles.\n\nThen, he returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Let's find out how many hours it takes to cover the same distance of 30 miles. We can do this by dividing the distance by the speed: 30 miles Ã· 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.\n\nSo, it will take Tom 5 hours to return.", "prediction": "5"}
{"question": "Mkoba wa kitabu wa Uriah unakuwa mzito sana kwake. Anahitaji kuondoa pauni 15 kwenye mkoba huo. Vitabu vyake vya futuhi vina uzani wa pauni 1/4 kila kimoja na wanasesere wake wana uzani wa pauni 1/2 kila mmoja. Akiondoa vitabu 30 vya futuhi, anahitaji kuondoa wanasesere wangapi?", "answer": 15, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem states that Uriah's book is very heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds from it. The book has 1/4 pound per page, and it has 30 pages. So, the total weight of the book is 30 pages x 1/4 pound/page = 30 x 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds, so he will remove 7.5 pounds (half of the book's weight) and leave the rest. The rest is 7.5 pounds - 15 pounds = -7.5 pounds (since you can't have a negative weight).\n\nThe problem also states that the book has 1/2 pound per toy, and it has 5 toys. So, the total weight of the toys is 5 toys x 1/2 pound/toy = 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 pounds.\n\nNow, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 pounds, and the book and toys together weigh 7.5 pounds + 2.5 pounds = 10 pounds. This means he needs to remove 10 pounds, which is not possible since the book and toys together weigh 10 pounds. This is a contradiction, so the problem is not solvable.", "prediction": "10"}

This means that the value of 1 silver coin is 1/35 of the value of 1 gold coin. So, the value of 1 silver coin is $175 Ã· 35 = $5.\n\nNext, we know that the value of 1 silver coin is twice the value of 1 copper coin. This means that the value of 1 copper coin is half the value of 1 silver coin.

Artie hana pesa zozote za thamani ya chini hivyo anaamua kufanya bei zake zote kufika dola inayokaribia. Iwapo Artie atauza nyungu 12 za matageta, nyungu 9 za petunia na nyungu 17 za begonia, atatengeneza pesa ngapi?", "answer": 88, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Artie sells 12 bags of matageta at $2.74 per bag, so he earns 12 * $2.74 = $33.48.\n2. He sells 9 bags of petunia at $1.87 per bag, so he earns 9 * $1.87 = $16.83.\n3. He sells 17 bags of begonia at $2.12 per bag, so he earns 17 * $2.12 = $36.36.\n4. In total, Artie earns $33.48 + $16.83 + $36.36 = $86.67.\n5. Since Artie wants to round his prices to the nearest dollar, he will round $86.67 to $87.\n\nSo, Artie will make $87 if he sells 12 bags of matageta, 9 bags of petunia, and 17 bags of begonia.", "prediction": "17"}

For every gallon of lemonade they make, it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. So, the total cost of 1 gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5.\n4. Since they made a profit of $25, they must have sold more lemonade than they bought. Let's say they bought x gallons of lemonade. Then, they sold x + 25/10 = x + 2.5 glasses of lemonade (since they made a profit of $25).\n5. Now, we can set up an equation: x + 2.5 = 20 (since a gallon can hold 20 glasses).

The information given is:\n\n* There are 50 locusts in the farm.\n* The number of grasshoppers is half the number of locusts.\n* Dax went to the farm to collect locusts and grasshoppers, which are a quarter of the total number of pests in the farm.\n\nLet's calculate the number of grasshoppers first. Since there are 50 locusts, the number of grasshoppers is half of that, which is 50 / 2 = 25.\n\nNow, Dax collected locusts and grasshoppers, which are a quarter of the total number of pests. To find the total number of pests, we add the number of locusts and grasshoppers: 50 + 25 = 75.\n\nSince Dax collected a quarter of the total number of pests, we need to find a quarter of 75, which is 75 / 4 = 18.75.\n\nSo, Dax collected 18.75 pests (locusts and grasshoppers) from the farm.", "prediction": "18.75"}

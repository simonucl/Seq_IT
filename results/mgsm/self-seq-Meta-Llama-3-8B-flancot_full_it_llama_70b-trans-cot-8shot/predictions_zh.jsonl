If their total age is 162, please calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Let's find the total age of Darel and Allen. Since their age ratio is 7:11, we can set up a ratio: Darel's age : Allen's age = 7 : 11. Let's say Allen's age is x. Then, Darel's age is 7x/11.\n2. The total age of Darel and Allen is 162. So, we can set up the equation: (7x/11) + x = 162.\n3. To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 11 to eliminate the fraction: 7x + 11x = 162 * 11. This simplifies to 18x = 162 * 11, or 18x = 1798.\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 1798 / 18 = 100.\n5. So, Allen's age is 100 years old.\n6.

The gold coin is more than the silver coin by 30, which means the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.\n3. Let's say the number of silver coins is x.

Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Leila's salary, so Leila's salary is 30% lower than Adrien's salary. Let's say Leila's salary is x. Then, Adrien's salary is x + 30% of x = x + 0.3x = 1.3x.\n\n2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increases by 40%, so his new salary is 1.3x + 40% of 1.3x = 1.3x + 0.4(1.3x) = 1.3x + 0.52x = 1.82x.\n\n3.

This is the sum of their new salaries: 1.82x + 1.4x = 3.22x.\n\n5. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. This means that 1.3x = 40,000.

In the Scottish Highlands, half of the unicorns are female. How many female unicorns are there in the Scottish Highlands?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. There are 27 unicorns worldwide.\n2. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, so we need to find one-third of 27. To do this, we can divide 27 by 3: 27 ÷ 3 = 9. This means there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.\n3. In the Scottish Highlands, half of the unicorns are female. Since there are 9 unicorns in total, half of them are female. To find half, we can divide 9 by 2: 9 ÷ 2 = 4.5. However, since we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, we can round down to 4.\n\nSo, there are 4 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.", "prediction": "4"}

The second team is less organized, and the first member takes 60 seconds to run the 400-meter segment.\n4. The second team's subsequent members are 3 seconds faster than the previous member.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time taken by each team:\n\nTeam 1:\n- 4 members, each taking 55 seconds = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds\nTeam 2:\n- 4 members, each taking 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 60 + 3 * 4 = 240 seconds\n\nSince Team 1 takes 220 seconds and Team 2 takes 240 seconds, Team 2 is 240 - 220 = 20 seconds slower.

{"question": "二十打杯子的总费用比半打盘子的总费用低 1,200 美元，每个盘子售价 6,000 美元。计算购买每个杯子的总费用。", "answer": 145, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nLet's translate the question into English:\n\n\"Twenty packs of cupcakes cost $1,200 less than half packs of cupcakes. Each cupcake costs $6,000. Calculate the total cost of buying each cupcake.\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Let's say the cost of half a pack of cupcakes is x.\n* Since 20 packs cost $1,200 less than half packs, we can set up the equation: 20x = x - 1,200.\n* To find the cost of half a pack, we can divide both sides by 20: x = 1,200 / 20 = 60.\n* So, half a pack costs $60.\n* Since each cupcake costs $6,000, we can calculate the number of cupcakes in a half pack: 60 / 6,000 = 0.01 (approximately).\n* Since 20 packs cost $1,200 less than half packs, we can calculate the cost of 20 packs: 20x - 1,200 = 20(60) - 1,200 = 1,200.\n* Now, we can find the cost of each cupcake in a 20-pack: 1,200 / 20 = $60.\n* Therefore, the total cost of buying each cupcake is $60.", "prediction": "60"}

{"question": "杰瑞有一群鸡。红鸡每天下 3 个蛋，白鸡每天下 5 个蛋。杰瑞每天收集 42 个鸡蛋。如果他的白鸡比红鸡多两只，他有多少只红鸡？", "answer": 4, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nLet's translate the question into English:\n\n\"Jerry has a group of chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. If his white chickens are 2 more than the red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, and he gets eggs from both red and white chickens.\n2. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. In total, they lay 3 + 5 = 8 eggs per day.\n3. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, and the total eggs laid per day are 8, he should have 42 - 8 = 34 eggs left to be laid by the red chickens.\n4. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so they will lay 34 / 3 = 11.33 days' worth of eggs.\n5. Since the white chickens are 2 more than the red chickens, the number of white chickens is 11.33 + 2 = 13.33.\n6. The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so they will lay 13.33 / 5 = 2.67 days' worth of eggs.\n7. In total, the red chickens lay 11.33 eggs, and the white chickens lay 2.67 eggs. This means the red chickens lay 11.33 / 3 = 3.77 eggs per day, which is close to 4 eggs per day.\n8. Since the problem doesn't allow for a fraction of a chicken, we'll assume the red chickens lay 4 eggs per day, which means they are 4 / 3 = 1.33 more than the original number of red chickens.\n9. The original number of red chickens is not specified, but we can assume it's 1 (since we're looking for the number of red chickens). Then, the number of red chickens is 1 + 1.33 = 2.33, which is close to 2.\n\nSo, the answer is: Jerry has approximately 2 red chickens.", "prediction": "2"}

If the total number of customers by the third day is 500, how many customers came to the store on the third day?\n\nStep-by-step answer:\n\nLet's start with the information we have:\n\n1. The total number of customers by the third day is 500.\n2. The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it's 100 + 50 = 150.\n3. The number of customers on the first day is 100.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of customers on the first and second days: 100 + 150 = 250.\n4. The total number of customers by the third day is 500, so we can set up the equation: 250 + x = 500, where x is the number of customers on the third day.\n5.

Now the big pool's water level is four times that of the small pool. How much water is in the small pool now?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. The big pool's water level is four times that of the small pool, so the water level in the big pool is 4 times the water level in the small pool.\n2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool's water level was twice that of the small pool, so the water level in the big pool was 2 times the water level in the small pool.\n3. Since the water level in the big pool is now 4 times that of the small pool, and 4 minutes ago it was 2 times that of the small pool, the water level in the small pool has decreased by 2 times the rate at which the big pool drained.\n4. The small pool drained at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so the small pool drained by 2 times this rate, which is 2 * 4 = 8 gallons per minute.\n5. Since the small pool drained for 4 minutes, it drained by 8 * 4 = 32 gallons.\n6. The small pool had some water in it initially, but we don't know how much. Let's call the initial water level \"x\". Then, the amount of water drained is 32 + x = 32 + x.\n7. The question doesn't give us the initial water level, but we can set up an equation: 32 + x = 32 + x (since the amount of water drained is equal to the amount of water drained).\n8. The equation simplifies to 32 + x = 32 + x, which means x = 0 (since 32 is already given).\n9. So, the small pool had 32 gallons of water initially, and it drained by 32 gallons, leaving it with 0 gallons of water.\n\nThe answer is: The small pool now has 0 gallons of water.", "prediction": "0"}

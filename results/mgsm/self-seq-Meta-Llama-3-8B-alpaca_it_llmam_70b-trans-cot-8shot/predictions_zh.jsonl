The number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties. The price of red ties is 50% higher than the price of blue ties. He spent 200 dollars on each blue tie. How much did he spend on ties in total?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's say there are x red ties and 2x blue ties. The total number of ties is x + 2x = 3x. The total price of ties is x + 2x = 3x. Since the price of red ties is 50% higher, the price of red ties is 1.5x. The total price of ties is x + 1.5x = 2.5x. He spent 200 dollars on each blue tie, so he spent 200 * 2x = 400 dollars on blue ties. The total he spent is 400 + 2.5x. Since he spent 200 dollars, we know 200 = 400 * 0.5 + 2.5x. Simplifying the equation, we get 200 = 400 * 0.5 + 2.5x. 200 = 200 + 2.5x. 2.5x = 200. x = 80. The total he spent is 400 + 2.5 * 80 = 440.\nThe Answer is: 440", "prediction": "440"}

When Julie reached the shore, how much water had her boat taken in?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Julie's boat takes in 2 feet of water with each stroke. So in 10 feet, it takes in 2 * 10 = 20 feet. In 20 feet, it takes in 2 * 20 = 40 feet. In 30 feet, it takes in 2 * 30 = 60 feet. In 40 feet, it takes in 2 * 40 = 80 feet. In 50 feet, it takes in 2 * 50 = 100 feet. In 60 feet, it takes in 2 * 60 = 120 feet. In 70 feet, it takes in 2 * 70 = 140 feet. In 80 feet, it takes in 2 * 80 = 160 feet. In 90 feet, it takes in 2 * 90 = 180 feet.

Leila's total salary is y. We are given that Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Leila's, so x = 1.3y.\n\nAfter 4 years, Adrian's salary increases, and his income is 40% higher than 4 years ago. Let's call his new salary z. We know that z = 1.4x, since it's 40% higher than his old salary.\n\nLeila's salary also increases, and her new salary is w. Since their salaries increase simultaneously, we can write w = 1.3y.\n\nWe are given that Adrian's salary 4 years ago is 40,000. We can use this information to find x and y.\n\nLet's start by using the fact that x = 1.3y. We can rewrite this as 1.3y - 40,000 = 0.\n\nWe can solve for y using the fact that w = 1.3y. We can rewrite this as 1.3y - 32,000 = 0.\n\nSolving for y, we get y = 32,000/1.3 = 25,000.\n\nNow that we have found y, we can find x using the fact that x = 1.3y.

He makes 15 minutes of calls to his boss every day. He made 300 minutes of calls to other people this month. If this month is 30 days long, how many more minutes of calls can he make this month?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Jason makes 1000 minutes of calls per month. He makes 15 minutes of calls to his boss every day, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. He made 300 minutes to other people, so in total he made 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

{"question": "グリフィンはフライドポテトを24本もっていましたが、カイルがそのうち5本を取りました。ビリーはカイルの2倍の数を取りました。ジンジャーはグリフィンに何本かあげましたが、コルビーがカイルより3本少ない数のフライドポテトをグリフィンから取りました。最終的にグリフィンが27本のフライドポテトをもっていた場合、ジンジャーがグリフィンにあげた数は何本ですか？", "answer": 20, "model_output": " Translation the question into English:\nQuestion: Griffin had 24 fried potatoes, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin some fried potatoes, but Corby took 3 fewer than Kyle from Griffin. If Griffin had 27 fried potatoes in the end, how many did Ginger give Griffin?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Griffin had 24 fried potatoes.\n2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 left.\n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he takes 2 * 5 = 10 more from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9.\n4. Ginger gave Griffin some fried potatoes, but Corby took 3 fewer than Kyle from Griffin. This means Corby takes 3 fried potatoes from Griffin, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 left.\n5. If Griffin had 27 fried potatoes in the end, it means he got some more from somewhere. Let's call the number of extra fried potatoes x.\n6. The total number of fried potatoes Griffin had was 24 + x. We know that x is at least 3 (because Corby took 3 fewer than Kyle), but we don't know the exact value of x.\n7. We can set up an equation based on the information we have:\n\n24 + x - 5 - 5 - 3 = 27\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n24 + x - 10 = 27\n\nSubtracting 24 from both sides gives:\n\nx = 27 - 24\nx = 3\n\nSo, Ginger gave Griffin 3 fried potatoes.\n\nThe Answer is: 3", "prediction": "3"}

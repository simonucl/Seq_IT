We know that there are fewer than half of them, so we can say that there are at most 175/2 = 87.5 silver coins. Since the number of silver coins is twice the number of gold coins, we can set up the equation:\n\n175 x 2 = 350\n\nWe know that the total number of coins is the sum of the gold and silver coins, so we can write:\n\n350 = 175 + 175\n\nSubtracting 175 from both sides gives us:\n\n175 = 175\n\nThis equation is true, so we can conclude that there are 175 gold coins and 175 silver coins in the treasure chest.\n\nThe Answer is: 350", "prediction": "350"}

Add this to his current salary: $3000 + $1200 = $4200.\n3. Lylah's salary has also increased simultaneously. Let's assume her salary is also $100. It has increased to $140. So her total salary is $140.\n4. The total salary of Adrien and Lylah is the sum of their individual salaries: $4200 + $140 = $4600.\n\nThe Answer is: $4600", "prediction": "4600"}

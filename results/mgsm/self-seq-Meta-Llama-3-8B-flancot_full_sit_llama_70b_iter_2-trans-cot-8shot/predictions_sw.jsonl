Alitumia pesa ngapi kununua tai?", "answer": 800, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's translate the question to English:\n\n\"John buys two more red shirts than blue shirts. The price of red shirts is 50% more than the price of blue shirts. He spent $200 on blue shirts, which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on red shirts?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the problem:\n\n1. John buys two more red shirts than blue shirts, so if he has x blue shirts, he has x + 2 red shirts.\n2. The price of red shirts is 50% more than the price of blue shirts, so the price of red shirts is $40 (the price of blue shirts) + 50% of $40 = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $60.\n3. John spent $200 on blue shirts, which cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue shirts.\n4. Now, let's find the total cost of red shirts. Since John bought x + 2 red shirts, the total cost of red shirts is (x + 2) * $60.\n\nWe know that the total cost of red shirts plus the total cost of blue shirts is $200, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(x + 2) * $60 + 5 * $40 = $200\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 2 = 200 / 100 - 5 / 2\nx + 2 = 195 / 2\nx + 2 = 97.5\n\nSubtracting 2 from x, we get:\n\nx = 97.5 - 2\nx = 95.5\n\nSo, John bought 95.5 blue shirts and 2 red shirts, and he spent $200 on blue shirts. To find the total cost of red shirts, we multiply the number of red shirts by the price of red shirts:\n\nTotal cost of red shirts = 2 * $60 = $120\n\nTherefore, John spent $120 on red shirts.", "prediction": "120"}

We are given some information about the coins:\n\n* There are 175 gold coins (almasi).\n* There are fewer silver coins than gold coins, and each silver coin is worth 35 times less than a gold coin. This means that the number of silver coins is less than 175 by a factor of 35. Let's call the number of silver coins \"x\". Then, the number of silver coins is 175 - 35x.\n* There are twice more copper coins than silver coins.

Now, we can find Lee's speed:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 400 meters / 120 seconds = 3.33 meters per second\n\nNext, we are told that Gerald can run 400 meters in 38 seconds. We can find his speed in the same way:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 400 meters / 38 seconds = 10.53 meters per second\n\nNow, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the same distance if he improves his speed by 10%. To do this, we need to find 10% of his original speed and add it to his original speed. Let's do the calculation:\n\nOriginal speed = 10.53 meters per second\n10% of original speed = 0.10 x 10.53 = 1.05 meters per second\nNew speed = Original speed + 10% of original speed = 10.53 + 1.05 = 11.58 meters per second\n\nSo, Gerald can run 400 meters in 11.58 seconds if he improves his speed by 10%.", "prediction": "10"}

His new salary was (1.4) × (1.3)x = 1.8x.\n\nSince Adrien and Lulah's salaries were the same four years ago, and Adrien's new salary is $40,000, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1.8x) = 40,000\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 40,000 / 1.8\nx = 22,222\n\nSo Lulah's salary four years ago was $22,222.\n\nNow, we need to find the total salary of Adrien and Lulah four years later.

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total: 20 - 12 - 4 = 4. So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars. To find the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100: (4 ÷ 20) × 100 = 20%.\n\nThe Answer is: 20%", "prediction": "20"}
{"question": "Kuna nyuki 700 katika mzinga wa nyuki. Idadi ya nyuki wa kufanya kazi ni mara mbili zaidi ya nyuki watoto, na idadi ya nyuki watoto ni mara tatu zaidi ya nyuki malkia.

The number of working bees is twice the number of child bees, and the number of child bees is three times the number of queen bees. How many working bees are there?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. There are 700 bees in the beehive.\n2. The number of working bees is twice the number of child bees, so let's call the number of child bees \"x\". Then, the number of working bees is 2x.\n3. The number of child bees is three times the number of queen bees, so let's call the number of queen bees \"y\". Then, the number of child bees is 3y.\n4. We know that the total number of bees is the sum of the working bees, child bees, and queen bees: 700 = 2x + 3y + y.\n5. Simplify the equation: 700 = 2x + 4y.\n6. Since the number of working bees is twice the number of child bees, we can set up an equation: 2x = 2y.\n7. Divide both sides by 2: x = y.\n8. Plug x = y back into the original equation: 700 = 2x + 4y = 2y + 4y = 6y.\n9. Divide both sides by 6: y = 700/6 = 116.67 (approximately).\n10. Since the number of working bees is twice the number of child bees, we can find the number of working bees: 2x = 2y = 2(116.67) = 233.34 (approximately).\n\nSo, the answer is: approximately 233.34 working bees.", "prediction": "233.34"}

Ili kudumisha biashara ya Sandra, ni lazima Fred awasilishe waridi mwekundu ngapi kabla ya saa 11 jioni?", "answer": 160, "model_output": " Let's break down the question step by step.\n\nThe question is asking how many red boxes Fred needs to deliver before 11 pm to maintain Sandra's business.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n* Sandra ordered 4 more red boxes than the number of pink boxes.\n* There are 5 times more pink boxes than the number of red boxes.\n* Sandra has 200 pink boxes.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of red boxes. Since there are 5 times more pink boxes than red boxes, we can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of red boxes = 5 × Number of pink boxes\n= 5 × 200\n= 1000\n\nSo, there are 1000 red boxes.\n\nNow, Sandra ordered 4 more red boxes than the number of pink boxes, so we can set up another equation:\n\nNumber of red boxes = Number of pink boxes + 4\n= 200 + 4\n= 204\n\nWait, this doesn't match our previous calculation! Let's think about it... If there are 1000 red boxes, and Sandra ordered 4 more than the number of pink boxes, that means she ordered 4 more than 204. So, the correct number of red boxes is indeed 204.\n\nNow, the question asks how many red boxes Fred needs to deliver before 11 pm. Since Sandra has 204 red boxes, and Fred needs to deliver at least 204 red boxes to maintain Sandra's business, the answer is:\n\n204", "prediction": "204"}

Two years ago, Mark was 5 and a half years older than Jean. If Jean is 30 years old, how old is Jean?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Mark's age is 30 - 2 = 28.\n2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 and a half years older than Jean, so Mark was 28 - 5.5 = 22.5 years old two years ago.\n3. Since Mark was 22.5 years old two years ago, and two years have passed, Mark's current age is 22.5 + 2 + 2 = 27.\n4. Jean is 30 years old, and Mark is 27 years old. To find Jean's age two years ago, subtract 2 from her current age: 30 - 2 = 28.\n5. Since Mark was 22.5 years old two years ago, and Jean was 28 years old two years ago, Jean is 28 - 22.5 = 5.5 years older than Mark two years ago.\n6. Mark was 5 and a half years older than Jean two years ago, so Mark's current age is 27, and Jean's current age is 27 + 5.5 = 32.5.\n\nTherefore, Jean is 32.5 years old.", "prediction": "32.5"}

Jerry has a 50% chance of winning if he rolls a 3 or more on the die.\n2. He wants to know his chances of winning if he rolls 3 more times in a row.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to calculate the probability of rolling 3 or more on the die 3 times in a row.\n\nSince the die has 6 sides, the probability of rolling a 3 or more on the die is 50% (1/2).\n\nTo find the probability of rolling 3 or more on the die 3 times in a row, we can multiply the probability of rolling a 3 or more on the die by itself 3 times:\n\n(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8\n\nSo, Jerry has a 1/8 chance of winning if he rolls 3 more times in a row.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply 1/8 by 100:\n\n1/8 × 100 = 12.5%\n\nTherefore, Jerry has a 12.5% chance of winning if he rolls 3 more times in a row.", "prediction": "3"}

Ikiwa biskuti 1 ina kalori 200, Sue alikula kalori ngapi zaidi ya dadake?", "answer": 5600, "model_output": " Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, let's translate the question to English:\n\nQuestion: On Monday, Sue ate 4 more biscuits than her dad. On Tuesday, she ate 2 more biscuits than her dad. Her dad ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 biscuits on Tuesday. If each biscuit has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than her dad?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 more biscuits than her dad, so Sue ate 5 (her dad's biscuits) + 4 = 9 biscuits.\n2. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 more biscuits than her dad, so Sue ate 9 (from Monday) + 2 = 11 biscuits.\n3. Her dad ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 biscuits on Tuesday, so in total her dad ate 5 + 13 = 18 biscuits.\n4. To find out how many calories Sue ate more than her dad, we need to subtract the calories her dad ate from the calories Sue ate. Sue ate 11 biscuits, and each biscuit has 200 calories, so Sue ate 11 * 200 = 2200 calories. Her dad ate 18 biscuits, so her dad ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. To find the difference, subtract 3600 from 2200: 2200 - 3600 = -1400.\n\nSo, Sue ate 1400 calories more than her dad.", "prediction": "1400"}

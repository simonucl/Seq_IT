Then, the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house is (1/3)x.\n\n2. At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she now has (1/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners.\n\n3. At the orange house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, which means she sold (1/2) * ((1/3)x + 2). Let's simplify this expression: (1/2) * ((1/3)x + 2) = (1/6)x + 1.\n\n4. Now, let's add up the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at each house: (1/3)x + (1/6)x + 1 + 2 = (5/6)x + 3.\n\n5. Since she started with x vacuum cleaners, she sold (5/6)x + 3 vacuum cleaners. To find out how many vacuum cleaners she has left, subtract the number of vacuum cleaners she sold from the total number of vacuum cleaners: x - (5/6)x - 3 = (1/6)x - 3.\n\n6.

We know that the book was bought for 19.50 dollars, and it was discounted by 75%. To find the original price, we need to calculate 75% of the original price and then subtract it from the discounted price.\n\nLet's start by finding 75% of the original price. To do this, we can multiply the original price by 0.75 (which is the same as 75%).\n\nLet's call the original price \"x\". Then, 75% of x is 0.75x.\n\nThe book was bought for 19.50 dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\n19.50 = 0.75x\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\nx = 19.50 ÷ 0.75\nx = 26\n\nSo, the original price of the book is 26 dollars.\n\nThe answer is: 26", "prediction": "26"}

First, we need to find out how many photos Brittany's phone can hold. Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of ducks, and there are 1,800 ducks, we can multiply the number of ducks by 50:\n1,800 ducks × 50 = 90,000 photos\n\nSo, Brittany's phone can hold 90,000 photos.\n\n2. Now, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Since Brittany's phone can hold 90,000 photos, we can multiply it by 6:\n90,000 photos × 6 = 540,000 photos\n\nSo, Jamal's phone can hold 540,000 photos.\n\n3. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, and it can hold 540,000 photos in total, we can subtract the number of photos already taken from the total capacity:\n540,000 photos - 1,800 photos = 538,200 photos\n\n4. Now, we need to find out how many ducks Jamal can see in his photos.

Since Steve lives farther away, he is allowed to ride a bike. Steve's house is 3 miles away from school, and he rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim's house is 2 miles away from school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait for the loser to complete the race before they get home?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Steve rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To find the time it takes him to cover 1 mile, we can divide the speed by 5280 (since there are 5280 feet in a mile). This gives us:\n\nTime to cover 1 mile = 440 feet/minute ÷ 5280 feet/mile = 0.083 minutes per mile\n\nSince Steve's house is 3 miles away, we can multiply the time by 3:\n\nTime to get home = 0.083 minutes per mile × 3 miles = 0.25 hours\n\nSteve will be home in 0.25 hours.\n\n2. Tim rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find the time it takes him to cover 1 mile, we can divide the speed by 5280 (again, since there are 5280 feet in a mile). This gives us:\n\nTime to cover 1 mile = 264 feet/minute ÷ 5280 feet/mile = 0.05 minutes per mile\n\nSince Tim's house is 2 miles away, we can multiply the time by 2:\n\nTime to get home = 0.05 minutes per mile × 2 miles = 0.1 hours\n\nTim will be home in 0.1 hours.\n\n3. Since Steve will be home in 0.25 hours and Tim will be home in 0.1 hours, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) to complete the race before they get home. To find the time the winner will wait, we can subtract the time it takes the loser to get home from the time it takes the winner to get home:\n\nTime the winner will wait = 0.25 hours - 0.1 hours = 0.15 hours\n\nSo, the winner will wait 0.15 hours, or 15 minutes, for the loser to complete the race before they get home.", "prediction": "15"}

If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, how much does Joe's candy bag weigh?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. We know there are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40 grams. So, the total weight of chocolate bars is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams.\n2. We also know there are 80 sugar-coated apples, but we don't know their weight. However, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each sugar-coated apple, so we can set up an equation: Weight of chocolate bar = 2 x Weight of sugar-coated apple. Let's call the weight of sugar-coated apple \"x\". Then, we can write: 40 = 2x.\n3. Solve for x: 40 ÷ 2 = x, so x = 20 grams.\n4. Now we know the weight of each sugar-coated apple is 20 grams.

Since there are 12 plates in a dozen, half a dozen would be 12 / 2 = 6 plates. The total cost of these 6 plates would be 6 * $6,000 = $36,000.\n\nNow, we know that the total cost of 20 cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. To find the total cost of 20 cups, we can set up an equation:\n\nTotal cost of 20 cups = Total cost of half a dozen plates - $1,200\n= $36,000 - $1,200\n= $34,800\n\nSince each cup costs the same amount, we can divide the total cost of 20 cups by 20 to find the cost of each cup:\n\nCost of each cup = Total cost of 20 cups ÷ 20\n= $34,800 ÷ 20\n= $1,740\n\nSo, the total cost of buying each cup is $1,740.", "prediction": "1740"}

Now, the big water pool has four times as much water as the small water pool.\n\nLet's use these points to set up an equation:\n\nLet x be the amount of water in the small water pool 4 minutes ago.\n\nSince the big water pool had twice as much water as the small water pool 4 minutes ago, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = 4x (since the big pool had 2x gallons, and the small pool had x gallons)\n\nNow, we can see that x must be 2, since 2x = 4x implies that the big pool had 4x gallons, which is not possible if the small pool had x gallons.\n\nSo, 4 minutes ago, the small water pool had 2 gallons of water.\n\nNow, the big water pool has four times as much water as the small water pool, so it has 4(2) = 8 gallons.\n\nThe small water pool is being drained at the same rate as the big water pool, so it will be drained at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, it will be drained by 4(4) = 16 gallons.\n\nTo find the amount of water in the small water pool now, we subtract the amount drained from the initial amount:\n\n2 gallons (initial) - 16 gallons (drained) = -14 gallons\n\nSo, the small water pool now has -14 gallons of water.

To find the total number of pieces they can complete per minute, we add Kendra's and her mom's rates: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.\n3. Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to complete the puzzle. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can complete per minute: 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes.\n4. Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.

Ashlyn picks these watermelons, so there are 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.\n\nTwo weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe, which means 3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons. Ashlyn picks all the ripe watermelons, so there are 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many watermelons are still not ripe. Since Ashlyn picked 63 ripe watermelons, the remaining watermelons are 84 - 63 = 21. However, 21 is not the correct answer because we need to find the number of watermelons that are still not ripe, not the total number of watermelons left.\n\nLet's think about it: if 30% of the watermelons were ripe after two months, and 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ripe two weeks later, that means the remaining watermelons are not ripe. Let's call the number of not-ripe watermelons \"x\". Then, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.3 * 120 = 36 (initially ripe)\n0.75 * (120 - 36) = 63 (ripe after two weeks)\n0.25 * x = 63 - 36 (not-ripe after two weeks)\nx = 63 - 36 / 0.25\nx = 144\n\nSo, there are 144 watermelons that are still not ripe.", "prediction": "144"}

{"question": "一个水族箱里有 4 只蜗牛，另一个水族箱里有 32 只蜗牛。这两个水族箱里的蜗牛数量之差是两个水族箱里鱼数量的两倍。如果两个水族箱里鱼的数量相同，每个水族箱里有多少条鱼？", "answer": 7, "model_output": " Let's break this down step by step!\n\nLet's translate the question to English:\n\nQuestion: There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. If the number of fish in each aquarium is the same, how many fish are in each aquarium?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. This means that the number of fish in each aquarium is half of the difference in the number of snails.\n\nLet the number of fish in each aquarium be x.\n\nSince the difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28, the number of fish in each aquarium is x = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\n2. Now that we know the number of fish in each aquarium, we can find the total number of fish. Since the number of fish in each aquarium is the same, we can multiply the number of fish by 2:\n\nTotal number of fish = 2 * 14 = 28\n\nSo, there are 28 fish in each aquarium.", "prediction": "28"}

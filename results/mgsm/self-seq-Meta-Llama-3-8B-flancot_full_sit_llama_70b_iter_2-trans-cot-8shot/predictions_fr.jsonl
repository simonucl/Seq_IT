We know that a bag of chips contains 250 calories per portion, and there are 5 portions in a 300g bag. To find the total calories in the bag, we can multiply the number of portions by the calories per portion: 5 portions x 250 calories/portion = 1250 calories.\n\n2. We know that our daily calorie goal is 2000, and we've already consumed 1800 calories. To find out how many calories we have left, we can subtract the calories we've already consumed from our daily goal: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.\n\n3. Since each portion of chips contains 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories (200) by the number of calories per portion to find out how many portions we can eat: 200 calories ÷ 250 calories/portion = 0.8 portions.\n\n4. Since there are 5 portions in a 300g bag, we can divide the number of portions we can eat (0.8) by the number of portions in a bag to find out how many grams of chips we can eat: 0.8 portions ÷ 5 portions/bag = 0.16 bags.\n\n5. Since each bag is 300g, we can multiply the number of bags we can eat (0.16) by the weight of each bag to find out how many grams of chips we can eat: 0.16 bags x 300g/bag = 48g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: you will eat 48g of chips.", "prediction": "48"}

Red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.\n2. Red ties cost 50% more, so they cost 1.5x (where x is the cost of one blue tie).\n3. He spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties he bought is 200 / 40 = 5.\n4. Now, let's find the total cost of ties. The cost of blue ties is 5x (since he bought 5 blue ties). The cost of red ties is 2x (since he bought 2x red ties). The total cost is 5x + 2x = 7x. Since red ties cost 1.5x, we can set up the equation 7x = 1.5x + 200. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 1.5 = 133.33.\n\nSo, Jean spent a total of $7x = $7(133.33) = $933.33 on ties.\n\nThe Answer is: $933.33", "prediction": "933.33"}

If a bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need to give her puppy 1 bowl of dog food per day. That's 180 days, so she'll need 180 bowls of dog food.\n2. Since each bag represents 110 bowls, we can divide the number of days by the number of bowls per bag: 180 days ÷ 110 bowls/bag = 1.636 bags.\n3. Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, Cecilia will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.\n4. For the rest of the year, Cecilia will need to give her puppy 2 bowls of dog food per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, she'll need 365 bowls of dog food.\n5. Again, we can divide the number of days by the number of bowls per bag: 365 days ÷ 110 bowls/bag = 3.318 bags.\n6. Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, Cecilia will need 4 bags of dog food for the rest of the year.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of bags Cecilia will need in the first year:\n\n2 bags (for the first 180 days) + 4 bags (for the rest of the year) = 6 bags\n\nSo, Cecilia will use 6 bags of dog food in the first year.", "prediction": "6"}

Since Adrien's salary was 40% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:\n\nAdrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 0.4(Lylah's salary)\n\nLet's say Lylah's salary is x. Then, Adrien's salary is x + 0.4x = 1.4x.\n\nWe know Adrien's initial salary was 40,000, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1.4x = 40,000\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 40,000 / 1.4 = 28,571.43\n\nSo Lylah's initial salary is approximately 28,571.43.\n\nNow, four years later, Adrien's salary has increased by 40% of his initial salary, which is:\n\nAdrien's new salary = 40,000 + 0.4(40,000) = 52,000\n\nLylah's salary has also increased by the same percentage, so her new salary is:\n\nLylah's new salary = 28,571.43 + 0.4(28,571.43) = 38,571.43\n\nNow, we need to find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:\n\nTotal salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary = 52,000 + 38,571.43 = 90,571.43\n\nTherefore, the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is approximately 90,571.43.", "prediction": "90571.43"}

How much money will he spend if each pepper costs $15?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. The cost of a pumpkin: Since a pumpkin costs three times more than a pepper, and each pepper costs $15, we can set up the equation: Cost of pumpkin = 3 × Cost of pepper = 3 × 15 = 45\n2. The cost of an orange: Since an orange costs five times less than a pumpkin, and each pumpkin costs $45, we can set up the equation: Cost of orange = 1/5 × Cost of pumpkin = 1/5 × 45 = 9\n3. Total cost of pumpkins: Dillon buys 4 pumpkins, so the total cost of pumpkins is 4 × 45 = 180\n4. Total cost of peppers: Dillon buys 20 peppers, and each costs $15, so the total cost of peppers is 20 × 15 = 300\n5.

To find the number of votes the winner got, we can multiply the total number of votes by 3/4:\n\nWinner's votes = Total votes × 3/4\n= 80 × 3/4\n= 60\n\nSo, the winner got 60 votes.\n\n2. To find the number of votes the loser got, we can subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:\n\nLoser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes\n= 80 - 60\n= 20\n\nTherefore, the loser got 20 votes.\n\nThe Answer is: 20", "prediction": "20"}
{"question": "Sandra, la fleuriste du coin, est très mécontente de la livraison incomplète effectuée par Fred. Sandra avait commandé quatre fois plus de roses rouges que d'œillets blancs. Elle avait également commandé 200 lys de calla roses, soit cinq fois la quantité d'œillets blancs. Sandra a menacé de changer de fournisseur si les roses rouges manquantes ne sont pas livrées avant 17 heures. Pour garder Sandra comme cliente, combien de roses rouges Fred doit-il livrer avant 17 heures ?", "answer": 160, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step!\n\n1. Sandra had ordered four times more roses red than carnations white. Let's call the number of roses red \"x\". Then, the number of carnations white is x/4.\n\n2. Sandra had also ordered 200 lilies of calla roses, which is five times the number of carnations white. So, the number of lilies of calla roses is 5x/4.\n\n3. The total number of flowers Sandra had ordered is the sum of roses red, carnations white, and lilies of calla roses: x + x/4 + 5x/4.\n\n4. Since Sandra had threatened to change suppliers if the missing roses red are not delivered before 5 pm, Fred needs to deliver at least as many roses red as Sandra had originally ordered. Let's call the number of roses red Fred needs to deliver \"y\". Then, y is at least x.\n\n5. To find the number of roses red Fred needs to deliver, we can set up an equation: y = x. Since x is the number of roses red Sandra had originally ordered, and y is the number of roses red Fred needs to deliver, we can conclude that y = x.\n\n6. Now, let's find the total number of flowers Fred needs to deliver: y + x/4 + 5x/4. Since y = x, this becomes x + x/4 + 5x/4.\n\n7. To find the total number of flowers Fred needs to deliver, we can simplify the expression: x + x/4 + 5x/4 = 9x/4.\n\n8. Since Fred needs to deliver at least 9x/4 flowers before 5 pm, the answer is 9x/4.", "prediction": "4"}

The first member takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent member is 3 seconds faster. To find the time for each member, we add 3 seconds to the previous member's time:\n\n60 seconds (first member) + 3 seconds = 63 seconds\n63 seconds + 3 seconds = 66 seconds\n66 seconds + 3 seconds = 69 seconds\n69 seconds + 3 seconds = 72 seconds\n\nThe total time for the second team is the sum of the times for each member:\n\n60 seconds + 63 seconds + 66 seconds + 69 seconds = 258 seconds\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in time between the two teams.

Let's call the total cost of the plates \"x\".\n2. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen would be 6 / 2 = 3 plates.\n3. The cost of each plate is 6,000 dollars, so the total cost of the half dozen plates is 3 plates x 6,000 dollars/plate = 18,000 dollars.\n4. The cups cost 1,200 dollars less than this total cost, so the cups cost 18,000 - 1,200 = 16,800 dollars.\n5. There are 12 cups in a dozen, so the total number of cups is 20 dozen x 12 cups/dozen = 240 cups.\n6. The total cost of the cups is 240 cups x 16,800 dollars/cup = 4,032,000 dollars.\n7.

André is planning a trip from New Jersey to Rochester. He thinks it will take 6 days to travel by bus, and half of that time to travel by car.\n\nLet's start with the bus trip. If it takes 6 days to travel by bus, and he's going to Rochester and back (so it's a round trip), that means he'll need to travel 6 days to get to Rochester and 6 days to come back, which is a total of 6 + 6 = 12 days.\n\nNow, the problem says it takes half of that time to travel by car. Half of 12 days is 12 / 2 = 6 days.\n\nSo, if André plans to travel to Rochester by bus and back, it will take him 12 days, and then he'll need to add the time it takes to travel back by car, which is 6 days. Therefore, the total number of days André will need to travel is 12 + 6 = 18 days.\n\nThe answer is: 18 days.", "prediction": "18"}

To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight of onions by the cost per pound: 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300.\n\nSo, the chef spent $300.", "prediction": "300"}
{"question": "Lundi, Sue a mangé 4 fois plus de biscuits que sa sœur. Mardi, elle en a mangé deux fois plus que sa sœur. Sa sœur a mangé 5 biscuits lundi et en a mangé 13 le lendemain. Si 1 biscuit contient 200 calories, combien de calories de plus que sa sœur Sue a-t-elle consommées ?", "answer": 5600, "model_output": " Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, let's find out how many biscuits Sue ate on Monday. Her sister ate 5 biscuits on Monday, and Sue ate 4 times more, so Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 biscuits on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many biscuits as her sister, and her sister ate 13 biscuits, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 biscuits on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 biscuits.\n\nNow, let's find out how many calories Sue consumed. Since each biscuit contains 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.\n\nThe question asks how many calories more Sue consumed than her sister. Since we don't know the exact number of calories her sister consumed, we can't find the exact difference. However, we can say that Sue consumed 9200 calories, which is more than her sister's consumption.", "prediction": "9200"}

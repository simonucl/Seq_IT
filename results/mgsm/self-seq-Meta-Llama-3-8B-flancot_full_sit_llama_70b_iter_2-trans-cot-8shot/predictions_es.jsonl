Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles per hour.\n2. She walked the next 2 miles in another hour, so her speed for the next 2 miles is also 2 miles per hour (since 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour).\n3.

I have 10 liters of orange juice, which contains two-thirds of water. To find the amount of water, I need to find two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds is the same as 2/3, so I'll multiply 10 by 2/3: 10 x 2/3 = 10 x 0.67 = 6.7 liters. So, there are approximately 6.7 liters of water in the orange juice.\n\n2. I want to add this orange juice to 15 liters of pineapple juice, which contains three-fifths of water. Again, I need to find three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths is the same as 3/5, so I'll multiply 15 by 3/5: 15 x 3/5 = 15 x 0.6 = 9 liters. So, there are approximately 9 liters of water in the pineapple juice.\n\n3.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he bought x blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.\n2. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 (blue ties) + 0.5 * $40 = $60 each.\n3. John spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.\n4. Now, let's find the total cost of ties. The cost of blue ties is $200, and the cost of red ties is 2x * $60. The total cost is $200 + 2x * $60.\n5. We know the total cost is $200 + 2x * $60 = $200 + 120x = $320. We can set up an equation: $320 = $200 + 120x.\n6. Solve for x: x = $320 - $200 = $120.\n7. Now, we know John bought 5 blue ties and 2x = 120 red ties.

If he builds a 4-level sandcastle, where the top level has a surface area of 16 square feet, what will be the average surface area of a level?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. The top level has 16 square feet of surface area.\n2. Since each level has half the surface area of the level below, we can find the surface area of the level below the top by dividing 16 by 2: 16 ÷ 2 = 8 square feet.\n3. The level below that would have half the surface area of the level below, so we divide 8 by 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4 square feet.\n4. We continue this pattern, dividing the surface area of each level by 2: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 square feet, and 2 ÷ 2 = 1 square foot.\n5. To find the average surface area of a level, we add up the surface areas of each level and divide by the number of levels: (16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1) ÷ 5 = 4 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the average surface area of a level in the sandcastle is 4 square feet.", "prediction": "4"}

Si una bolsa de alimento para perros contiene 110 tazas, ¿cuántas bolsas de alimento para perros usará Cecilia durante el primer año?", "answer": 5, "model_output": " Let's break this problem down step by step!\n\nFirst, let's find out how many days Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can divide the number of days by the number of cups per day:\n\n180 days ÷ 1 cup/day = 180 cups\n\nNow, let's find out how many cups of food Cecilia needs for the rest of her puppy's life (after the first 180 days). Since she needs to feed her puppy with 2 cups of food per day from then on, we can multiply the number of cups per day by the number of days:\n\n∞ days (rest of her puppy's life) × 2 cups/day = ∞ cups\n\nSince we can't calculate an infinite number of cups, let's assume we'll use a reasonable estimate. Let's say Cecilia will feed her puppy with 2 cups of food per day for the rest of its life, which is approximately 10 years (assuming a dog's average lifespan is around 10 years). There are 365 days in a year, so:\n\n10 years × 365 days/year × 2 cups/day = 7300 cups\n\nNow, let's find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use during the first year. Since each bag contains 110 cups of food, we can divide the total number of cups needed during the first year by the number of cups per bag:\n\n180 cups (first 180 days) + 7300 cups (rest of life) ÷ 110 cups/bag = 16 bags\n\nSo, Cecilia will use 16 bags of dog food during the first year.", "prediction": "16"}

Since 9 bunches of 2 units is more expensive ($9), Vincent will buy 6 bunches of 3 units.\n4. The total cost of buying 6 bunches of 3 units is 6 x $2.50 = $15.\n5. The total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15.\n6. To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price from the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price: $15 - $18 = -$3\n\nSo, Vincent saves $3 if he buys 18 flowers at the better price.", "prediction": "18"}

But Gerald has improved his diet, which has increased his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the course in 38 seconds, how many seconds faster can Gerald run it now?\n\nLet's start by finding out how fast Gerald can run the course without his diet improvement. Since Lee can run it 2 seconds faster, Gerald can run it 2 seconds slower, so Gerald's initial time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.\n\nNow, Gerald has improved his diet by 10%, which means he can run 10% faster. To find out how much faster he can run, we need to calculate 10% of his initial time: 40 x 0.10 = 4 seconds. So, Gerald can run the course 4 seconds faster now.\n\nTo find the total time difference, we add the initial difference (2 seconds) to the new difference (4 seconds): 2 + 4 = 6 seconds.\n\nTherefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter obstacle course 6 seconds faster than Lee now!", "prediction": "6"}

The boat starts with an unknown amount of water, but we'll figure it out as we go along.\n2. The boat leaks 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it moves away from the shore. Since Julia remades 20 feet in 16 seconds, the boat moved 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. Since 1.25 feet is not a whole number, we'll round down to 1 foot per second. So, the boat leaks 2 liters per 10 feet, and it moved 1 foot per second, so it leaks 2/10 = 0.2 liters per second.\n3. The boat started 64 seconds away from the shore, and it took 16 seconds to reach the shore. The time it took to leak water is 64 - 16 = 48 seconds.

{"question": "El teléfono de Jamal puede guardar 6 veces más fotografías que el teléfono de Brittany. La cantidad máxima de fotografías que puede guardar el teléfono de Brittany es 50 veces más que la cantidad de aves que hay en la fotografía que Jamal tomó de los patos en el zoológico. Si el teléfono de Jamal puede guardar 1800 fotografías, ¿cuántos patos se pueden ver en la fotografía que Jamal tomó de los patos en el zoológico?", "answer": 6, "model_output": " Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, we need to understand the information we have:\n\n* Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.\n* Brittany's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of birds in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo.\n* Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.\n\nLet's start by using the information about Brittany's phone. Since it can store 50 times more photos than the number of birds, and Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, we can set up an equation:\n\nBrittany's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of birds, so the number of birds is 1800 / 50 = 36.\n\nNow, we know that Brittany's phone can store 36 photos. Since Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we can multiply 36 by 6:\n\nJamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so it can store 36 x 6 = 216 photos.\n\nBut we know that Jamal's phone can actually store 1800 photos, so we can subtract 216 from 1800 to find out how many photos are left:\n\n1800 - 216 = 1584 photos.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many ducks are in the photo. Since the photo is taken at the zoo, and it's a photo of ducks, we can assume that the number of ducks is equal to the number of photos. Therefore, there are 1584 ducks in the photo.\n\nSo, the answer is: 1584 ducks!", "prediction": "1584"}

Four years later, his salary had increased and he earned 40% more than he did four years ago. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased at the same rate, and four years ago Adrien earned $40,000, calculate their total salary four years later.\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.\n2. His salary increased by 40% over four years, so his new salary is:\n$40,000 x 1.4 = $56,000\n3. Lylah's salary four years ago was unknown, but we know it was 30% lower than Adrien's salary, so:\nLylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago - 30% of Adrien's salary\n= $40,000 - 0.3 x $40,000\n= $40,000 - $12,000\n= $28,000\n4.

To find the number of votes the winner got, we can multiply the total votes by 3/4:\n\nWinner's votes = Total votes × 3/4\n= 80 × 3/4\n= 60\n\nSo, the winner got 60 votes.\n\n2. To find the number of votes the loser got, we can subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:\n\nLoser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes\n= 80 - 60\n= 20\n\nTherefore, the loser got 20 votes.", "prediction": "20"}
{"question": "Sandra, la florista de la esquina, está muy desconforme con la entrega incompleta del pedido de Fred. Sandra había pedido cuatro veces más rosas rojas que claveles blancos. También pidió 200 calas rosas, que eran cinco veces la cantidad de claveles blancos. Sandra amenazó con cambiar de proveedor si no recibía las rosas rojas que faltaban antes de las 5 p. m. ¿Cuántas rosas rojas debe entregar Fred antes de las 5 p. m. para conservar el negocio de Sandra?", "answer": 160, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step!\n\n1. Sandra had 4 times more roses red than white, so if she had x white roses, she had 4x red roses.\n2. She also had 200 red roses, which is 5 times the number of white roses, so 200 = 5x.\n\nWe can set up an equation using these two statements:\n\n4x = 200\nx = 200/4\nx = 50\n\nSo Sandra had 50 white roses and 4(50) = 200 red roses.\n\n3. Fred needs to deliver the missing roses before 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. Since Sandra had 200 red roses and Fred needs to deliver half of them, he needs to deliver 200/2 = 100 red roses.\n\nTherefore, Fred needs to deliver 100 red roses before 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.", "prediction": "5"}

We know that Jean is 2 years older than Mark, and Mark is 5 years older than half of Jean's age 2 years ago.\n\nLet's start with the information that Jean has 30 years old. Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Mark's age is 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nNow, 2 years ago, Jean's age would be 30 - 2 = 28, and Mark's age would be 28 - 2 = 26.\n\nSince Mark is 5 years older than half of Jean's age 2 years ago, half of Jean's age 2 years ago is 26 / 5 = 5.2. So, Mark's age 2 years ago is 5.2 + 2 = 7.2.\n\nNow, we can find Mark's current age by adding 2 years to his age 2 years ago: 7.2 + 2 = 9.2.\n\nSince Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 9.2 + 2 = 11.2.\n\nSo, Jean is 11.2 years old.", "prediction": "11.2"}

The total cost of the cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Let's call the total cost of the plates \"x\". Then, the total cost of the cups is x - 1200.\n3. Each plate costs $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is x = 6 x 6000 = 36,000.\n4. The total cost of the cups is x - 1200, and we know that it's equal to the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is 36,000. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx - 1200 = 36,000\n\n5.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs laid per day is 3 (red) + 5 (white) = 8 eggs per day.\n3. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, the number of days he can collect eggs is 42 ÷ 8 = 5.25 days. (Let's round down to 5 days, as we can't collect eggs for a fraction of a day.)\n4. The number of red chickens is unknown, but we know Jerry has twice as many white chickens as red chickens. Let's call the number of red chickens \"x\". Then, the number of white chickens is 2x.\n5. In 5 days, the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so they lay a total of 3x eggs.\n6. The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so they lay a total of 5(2x) = 10x eggs.\n7.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had the same amount of water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?\n\nStep-by-Step Answer:\n\nLet's start by thinking about the situation. We know that both pools had the same amount of water 4 minutes ago. Let's call the amount of water in each pool \"x\" gallons.\n\nSince both pools had the same amount of water, we can set up an equation:\n\nx = 4x (since both pools had the same amount of water 4 minutes ago)\n\nNow, we know that the big pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool. This means that the big pool has 4x gallons of water, and the small pool has x gallons of water.\n\nWe can set up another equation:\n\n4x = 4x + x (since the big pool has 4 times the amount of water as the small pool)\n\nSubtracting x from both sides gives us:\n\n3x = 3x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 3x/3\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the small pool had 1 gallon of water 4 minutes ago.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half of that, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.\n2. To find out how many pieces they can add in an hour, we need to multiply the number of pieces they can add per minute by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour): 4 pieces/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 240 pieces/hour.\n3. Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per hour: 360 pieces ÷ 240 pieces/hour = 1.5 hours.\n4.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If the two aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are in each aquarium?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. This means that the number of snails in one aquarium minus the number of snails in the other aquarium is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums.\n\nLet's call the number of snails in one aquarium \"x\" and the number of snails in the other aquarium \"32\". Then, the difference is 32 - x = 2k, where k is the number of fish in both aquariums.\n\n2. Since the difference is twice the number of fish, we can set up the equation:\n\n32 - x = 2k\n\n3. The number of snails in one aquarium is x, and the number of snails in the other aquarium is 32. Since the total number of snails is the same in both aquariums, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 32 = 2k + k\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n\nx + 32 = 3k\n\n5. Since the two aquariums have the same number of fish, k is the same for both aquariums. Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium \"k\".\n\n6. Now, we can find the number of fish in each aquarium:\n\nx + 32 = 3k\nx = 3k - 32\nk = x/3 + 32/3\nk = (x + 32)/3\n\n7. Since the number of fish in each aquarium is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\nk = (x + 32)/3\nk = (3k - 32)/3\n3k = 3k - 32\nk = -32/3\nk = -10.67 (approximately)\n\n8. Now, we can find the number of fish in each aquarium:\n\nk = -10.67 (approximately)\nx = 3k - 32\nx = 3(-10.67) - 32\nx = -32.01 (approximately)\nx = -10.67 (approximately)\n\nSo, the number of fish in each aquarium is approximately -10.67.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed: 46 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.\n5. The question asks how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister. We don't know the exact number of calories her sister consumed, but we can find the difference: 9200 (Sue's calories) - unknown (her sister's calories) = unknown.\n\nHowever, we can try to find an approximate answer by assuming her sister consumed a similar number of cookies on Monday and Tuesday. Let's say her sister consumed 5 cookies on Monday and 10 cookies on Tuesday (which is a reasonable assumption). Then, her sister consumed a total of 5 + 10 = 15 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, her sister consumed 15 x 200 = 3000 calories.\n\nNow, we can find the difference: 9200 (Sue's calories) - 3000 (her sister's calories) = 6200 calories. Therefore, Sue consumed approximately 6200 more calories than her sister.", "prediction": "6200"}

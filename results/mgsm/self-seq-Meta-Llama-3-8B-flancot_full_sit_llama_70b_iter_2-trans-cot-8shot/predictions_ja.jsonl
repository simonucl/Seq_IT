If she can skip 3 miles in 1 hour, and she walks for 3/4 of the time and skips for 1/4 of the time, how many kilometers will she cover in 6 hours?\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n1. Dana can run at 4 times the speed of walking, so her running speed is 4 times the walking speed. Let's say her walking speed is x. Then, her running speed is 4x.\n\n2. She can skip at half of her running speed, so her skipping speed is half of 4x, which is 2x.\n\n3. She covers 3 miles in 1 hour, so her speed is 3 miles/hour. We need to find x. Since 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers, we can convert the speed to kilometers per hour: 3 miles/hour = 3 × 1.60934 = 4.82832 kilometers/hour.\n\n4. Now, we can find x: x = 4.82832 kilometers/hour.\n\n5. Since she walks for 3/4 of the time and skips for 1/4 of the time, she walks for 3/4 of 6 hours = 3/4 × 6 = 4.5 hours, and skips for 1/4 of 6 hours = 1/4 × 6 = 1.5 hours.\n\n6. In 4.5 hours, she walks 4.82832 kilometers/hour, so she walks 4.5 × 4.82832 = 22.195 kilometers.\n\n7. In 1.5 hours, she skips 2x kilometers, so she skips 1.5 × 2x = 3x kilometers.\n\n8. In 6 hours, she covers the total distance: 22.195 kilometers (walking) + 3x kilometers (skipping) = 25.195 kilometers + 3x kilometers.\n\n9. We can set up an equation: 25.195 + 3x = 25.195 + 3x (since 25.195 + 3x = 25.195 + 3x).\n\n10. Simplify the equation: 3x = 0.\n\n11. Solve for x: x = 0.\n\n12.

So, Arthur will set the prices as follows:\n\n* Marigold: $2.75 (rounding up from $2.74)\n* Petunia: $1.88 (rounding up from $1.87)\n* Begonia: $2.13 (rounding up from $2.12)\n\nIf Arthur sells 12 pots of Marigold, 9 pots of Petunia, and 17 pots of Begonia, he will earn:\n\n$2.75 x 12 = $33.00\n$1.88 x 9 = $16.92\n$2.13 x 17 = $35.91\n\nAdding up the total earnings, Arthur will get:\n\n$33.00 + $16.92 + $35.91 = $85.00\n\nSo, Arthur can sell all the flowers for $85.00.", "prediction": "85.00"}

The veterinarian recommends feeding the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, and then 2 cups per day for the rest of the puppy's life. A bag of dog food contains 110 cups.\n\nLet's calculate the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:\n\n1 cup/day × 180 days = 180 cups\n\nSince each bag contains 110 cups, we can divide the total cups needed by the number of cups in a bag:\n\n180 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 1.636 bags\n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Freida is making tomato sauce, and she uses 16-ounce cans of tomatoes with 3 tomatoes in each can. The last batch of sauce she made used 32 ounces of tomatoes. The question is, how many tomatoes did Freida use in total?\n\nLet's start by calculating the number of tomatoes used in the last batch: 32 ounces x 3 tomatoes/can = 96 tomatoes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes used by Freida: 96 tomatoes (from the last batch) + unknown number of tomatoes (from the other batches).\n\nSince the volume of the tomatoes used in the last batch is half of the total volume (32 ounces), we can set up an equation: Total volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces, and half of it is 32/2 = 16 ounces. This means the total volume of tomatoes used by Freida is 16 ounces.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used: 16 ounces x 3 tomatoes/can = 48 tomatoes.\n\nSo, Freida used a total of 48 tomatoes.", "prediction": "48"}

The question states that Jamal's phone can save 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Let's assume Brittany's phone can save x photos. Then, Jamal's phone can save 6x photos.\n\nNext, we need to find the maximum number of photos that can be saved on Brittany's phone. The question states that this number is 50 times the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took at the zoo. Let's assume there are y ducks in the photo. Then, the maximum number of photos that can be saved on Brittany's phone is 50y.\n\nNow, we know that Jamal's phone can save 6x photos, and Brittany's phone can save 50y photos. The total number of photos that can be saved is the sum of these two numbers: 6x + 50y.\n\nThe question states that Jamal's phone can save 1800 photos. We can set up an equation to represent this: 6x + 50y = 1800.\n\nTo find the value of x, we can subtract 50y from both sides of the equation: 6x = 1800 - 50y.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of y (the number of ducks in the photo) to find the value of x. Let's say y = 10. Then, 6x = 1800 - 50(10) = 1800 - 500 = 1300.\n\nSo, x = 1300. Now we can find the total number of photos that can be saved: 6x + 50y = 6(1300) + 50(10) = 7800 + 500 = 8300.\n\nThe question asks how many ducks are in the photo Jamal took at the zoo. Since the maximum number of photos that can be saved on Brittany's phone is 50 times the number of ducks, we can set up an equation: 50y = 8300.\n\nTo find the value of y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50: y = 8300 ÷ 50 = 166.\n\nTherefore, there are 166 ducks in the photo Jamal took at the zoo.", "prediction": "166"}

Then, we can set up the equation:\n\nAdrian's total income = Lily's salary + 30% of Lily's salary\n= x + 0.3x\n= 1.3x\n\nWe know that Adrian's total income is 56,000, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1.3x = 56,000\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 56,000 / 1.3\n= 43,076\n\nSo Lily's current salary is 43,076.\n\nNow, we need to find the total income of Adrian and Lily 4 years later. Since their salaries increased by 40% and 30% respectively, we can calculate their total income as follows:\n\nAdrian's total income 4 years later = Adrian's current salary × 1.4 (40% increase)\n= 56,000 × 1.4\n= 78,400\n\nLily's total income 4 years later = Lily's current salary × 1.3 (30% increase)\n= 43,076 × 1.3\n= 55,988\n\nThe total income of Adrian and Lily 4 years later is the sum of their individual incomes:\n\nTotal income = 78,400 + 55,988\n= 134,388\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 134,388.", "prediction": "134388"}

Each customer's house requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloth for cleaning. The bleach bottles cost $2 each, and the cloth packs cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculated that his total weekly income will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. How much profit will Lucas make each week?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. Kim has 3 customers, and each customer requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloth. Total cost per customer = 2 bottles x $2/bottle + 1 pack x $5/pack = $7 per customer.\n2. Kim is talking to 5 potential customers, but he's confident he can include them in his calculation. So, he'll add 5 customers to his existing 3 customers, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 customers.\n3. Total weekly income = Number of customers x Cost per customer = 8 customers x $7/customer = $56 per week.\n4. Total weekly expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloth = 2 bottles x $2/bottle + 1 pack x $5/pack = $7 per week.\n5. Total weekly profit = Total weekly income - Total weekly expenses = $56 - $7 = $49 per week.\n\nTherefore, Lucas will make a profit of $49 per week.", "prediction": "49"}

We know the total price of all items is $34, so we can set up the equation:\n\n5x + $15 + $15 + $4 = $34\n\nSubtract $15 + $15 + $4 from both sides:\n\n5x = $34 - $15 - $15 - $4\n5x = $34 - $23\n5x = $11\nx = $11 ÷ 5\nx = $2.20\n\nSo, each red car costs $2.20. The total price of all items is $34, and the red cars cost $11, leaving $34 - $11 = $23. This means the red cars are on sale for $2.20 each, and the total price of all items is correct!\n\nThe answer is: The total value of all toys is $34.", "prediction": "34"}

If Sara already has $10 saved, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to buy the jacket and shoes?\n\nNow, let's think step by step about the problem:\n\n1. Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes for $20 each, so she needs a total of $30 + 2 * $20 = $70.\n2. She already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.\n3. She earns $5 for taking care of her neighbor's children four times, so she needs to do this four times to earn $5 * 4 = $20.\n4. Her parents give her $4 every time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn four times to earn $4 * 4 = $16.\n5. To earn the remaining $20, she needs to do a combination of taking care of children and mowing the lawn. Let's say she takes care of children three times and mows the lawn once, earning $15.

{"question": "スティーブはもっとトマトを食べようと決意し、自分のチェリートマトの栽培を始めることにしました。彼はガールフレンドの2倍の量のトマトを食べます。彼は1日あたり6個のトマトを食べます。1つのつるから1週間あたり3つのトマトを作れるとした場合、スティーブは何本のつるが必要でしょうか？", "answer": 21, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day.\n2. He eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats half of Steve's tomatoes. Half of 6 is 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.\n3. Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so together they eat 3 + 6 = 9 tomatoes per day.\n4. Since Steve wants to eat more tomatoes, he decides to grow his own tomatoes. He can grow 3 tomatoes per week from one plant.\n5. To find out how many plants Steve needs, we can divide the total number of tomatoes he wants to eat per week by the number of tomatoes he can grow from one plant. 9 tomatoes per day is equivalent to 9 / 7 = 1.29 tomatoes per day (assuming 7 days in a week). So, Steve needs 1.29 tomatoes per day from his own plants.\n6. Since Steve can grow 3 tomatoes per week from one plant, he needs 1.29 / 3 = 0.43 plants per day. To find the total number of plants he needs, we can multiply the number of plants per day by the number of days in a week. 0.43 plants per day × 7 days per week = 3.01 plants per week.\n\nTherefore, Steve needs approximately 3 plants to grow tomatoes for 1 week.", "prediction": "1"}

On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. If one cookie is 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue eat compared to her sister?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n1. On Monday, Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister, so we don't know the exact number of cookies she ate. But we know her sister ate 5 cookies.\n2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we need to find out how many cookies her sister ate on Tuesday. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can set up an equation: 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies. So her sister ate 18 cookies on Monday and Tuesday.\n3. Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Sue ate: 5 cookies on Monday (200 calories/cookie) = 1000 calories, 13 cookies on Tuesday (200 calories/cookie) = 2600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue ate compared to her sister, subtract the total calories her sister ate from the total calories Sue ate: 3600 (Sue) - 3600 (sister) = 0 calories.\n\nSo, the answer is: Sue ate the same number of calories as her sister.", "prediction": "0"}

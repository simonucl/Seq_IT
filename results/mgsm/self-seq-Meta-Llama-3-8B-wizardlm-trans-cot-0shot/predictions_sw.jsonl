{"question": "Lundo la ukungu linabingirika kutoka kwa bahari na kufunika jiji. Linachukua dakika 10 kufunika kila maili 3 za jiji. Iwapo jiji lina upana wa maili 42 kutoka ufuo wa bahari hadi ng'ambo nyingine ya nchi kavu, lundu hilo la ukungu litachukua dakika ngapi kufunika jiji zima?", "answer": 140, "model_output": " The ukungu in this question translates to \"the bridge\" in English. The question asks how long it takes for the bridge to cross the city. The bridge spans 3 miles of the city and takes 10 minutes to cross each mile. If the city is 42 miles long from the ocean to the other side of the country, how many minutes does it take for the bridge to cross the entire city? \nTo answer this question, we need to first convert miles to kilometers. One mile is equal to 1.609 kilometers. \nNext, we need to calculate how many kilometers the bridge spans across the city. \n3 miles of the city is equal to 3 x 1.609 kilometers = 4.827 kilometers. \nNow we can use the formula: \ntime = distance / speed \nwhere time is in minutes, distance is in kilometers, and speed is in kilometers per minute. \nWe know that the speed of the bridge is 1,000 kilometers per minute (10 minutes to cross each mile). \nSo we can calculate the time it takes for the bridge to cross the city: \ntime = 4.827 kilometers / 1,000 kilometers per minute \ntime = 0.004827 minutes \ntime = 0.02823 minutes \nTherefore, it takes approximately 1.67 minutes (or 10 seconds) for the bridge to cross the entire city.", "prediction": "10"}

The box on the left is 5 inches wide, the box in the center is 6 inches wide, and the box on the right is 4 inches wide. The length of the box is not specified. \nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the boxes. Let's assume that all three boxes have the same length. \nIf the boxes are all the same length, then the total length of all three boxes would be 3 times that length. \nSo, we need to find the length of one box, and then multiply that by 3 to get the total length of all three boxes. \nLet's start with the box on the left. We know that it is 5 inches wide. If it is also 5 inches long, then the total length of all three boxes would be 3 x 5 = 15 inches. \nNow, let's look at the box in the center. We know that it is 6 inches wide. If it is also 6 inches long, then the total length of all three boxes would be 3 x 6 = 18 inches. \nFinally, let's look at the box on the right. We know that it is 4 inches wide. If it is also 4 inches long, then the total length of all three boxes would be 3 x 4 = 12 inches. \nTherefore, the total length of all three boxes would be 15 + 18 + 12 = 45 inches. \nSo, the answer is 45 inches.", "prediction": "45"}

Iwapo Jessica anataka kulipa 50% zaidi ya kiwango cha chini zaidi, huwa analipa pesa ngapi kwa mwaka?", "answer": 18000, "model_output": " If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she would pay $450 per month. \nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the question: \n1. Jessica has a student loan with a minimum payment of $300 per month. \n2. Her credit card payments have a minimum payment of $200 per month. \n3. Her rent payments have a minimum payment of $500 per month. \n4. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for her student loan. \n5. To calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, we can multiply the minimum payment by 1.5 (50% more than the minimum). \n6. So, the additional amount she needs to pay for her student loan is $450 per month (1.5 x $300). \n7. Therefore, the total amount she needs to pay for her student loan, credit card payments, and rent is $1,050 per month ($300 + $200 + $500). \n8. If she pays this amount, she will be paying 50% more than the minimum payment for her student loan.", "prediction": "50"}

Josh invested $50,000 in renovations, so the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nAfter the renovations, the house's value increased by 150%, which means it's now worth 1.5 times the original value. To find the new value, we can multiply the original value by 1.5: $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000.\n\nSo, the house is now worth $120,000. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the new value: $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Josh lost $10,000 on the renovation project.", "prediction": "10000"}

To find the rate of water leaking, we divide the number of gallons by the time: 2 gallons / 16 seconds = 0.125 gallons per second.\n4. The boat takes 64 seconds to reach the shore, so it leaks 0.125 gallons per second for 64 seconds. To find the total amount of water leaked, we multiply the rate by the time: 0.125 gallons/second × 64 seconds = 8 gallons.\n5. Therefore, when Julie reaches the shore, her boat has leaked 8 gallons of water.", "prediction": "8"}

{"question": "阿德里安的总工资比莱拉的总工资高 30%。四年后，他的工资上涨了，他的收入比四年前高出 40%。如果阿德里安的工资和莱拉的工资同时上涨，阿德里安四年前的收入是 40,000 美元，请计算两个人四年后的工资总额?", "answer": 95200, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nLet's start with what we know:\n\n1. Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Lara's salary, so let's say Lara's salary is x. Then, Adrian's salary is x + 30% of x = x + 0.3x = 1.3x.\n2. Four years later, Adrian's salary has increased by 40%, so his new salary is 1.3x + 40% of 1.3x = 1.3x + 0.4(1.3x) = 1.3x + 0.52x = 1.82x.\n3. Since both Adrian and Lara's salaries have increased by the same percentage (40%), their new salaries are equal. So, we can set up the equation: 1.82x = x + 40,000.\n4. Subtract x from both sides: 1.82x - x = 40,000, which simplifies to 1.71x = 40,000.\n5. Divide both sides by 1.71: x = 23,529.\n6. So, Lara's salary is $23,529, and Adrian's salary is $23,529 + 30% of $23,529 = $30,789.\n7.

The story doesn't mention how many chips each person ate, but it says 3 people shared the remaining chips. So, 7 chips were shared among 3 people, which means each person got 7 / 3 = 2.33 chips (round up to 2).\n4. The story says the last person left 2 chips behind, so the person who took the last chips had 2 + 2 = 4 chips.\n5. The question asks how many chips were in the bag when Dave bought it.

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, so he spends 1/4 * $6000 = $1500 on rent.\n2. He spends 1/3 of his salary on gasoline, so he spends 1/3 * $6000 = $2000 on gasoline.\n3. He spends 1/2 of the remaining amount on his daughter's expenses, so he spends 1/2 * ($6000 - $1500 - $2000) = $1500 on his daughter's expenses.\n4. He gives $700 to his wife to buy groceries and other household items.\n5. In total, he spends $1500 + $2000 + $1500 + $700 = $6000 on all expenses.\n6. Since he earns $6000 per month, he has $6000 - $6000 = $0 left after all expenses.\n\nSo, the answer is: Zaid has $0 left after all expenses.", "prediction": "0"}

The first team has a fast car that can go 55 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters).\n4. The second team's first car can go 60 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second.\n5. The second team's other cars can go 3 seconds faster than the first car, which means they can go 60 - 3 = 57 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second.\n6. Now, let's compare the speeds: 400 meters per second (team 1's fast car) is faster than 400 meters per second (team 2's first car) and 400 meters per second (team 2's second car).\n7.

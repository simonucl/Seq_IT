To find the average depth, we need to add the minimum and maximum depths and then divide by 2.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nAverage depth = (Maximum depth + Minimum depth) / 2\n= (16 + 4) / 2\n= 20 / 2\n= 10 feet\n\nSo, the average depth of the sandcastle's foundation is 10 feet.", "prediction": "10"}

So, in total, she will need 180 cups of dog food.\n\nIn the next phase, she will need to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 365 days in a year, she will need 365 cups of dog food per year.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of cups of dog food she will need:\n\n180 cups/day for 180 days + 365 cups/day for the rest of the year = 180 + 365 = 545 cups\n\nSince each cup of dog food is equivalent to 110 cups, she will need:\n\n545 cups / 110 cups/cup = 5 years\n\nSo, Cecilia will need 5 years' worth of dog food, which is equivalent to 5 * 365 = 1825 cups of dog food.", "prediction": "1825"}

John drinks 1 glass of water during breakfast, 1 glass during tea time, and 1 glass before bedtime, so in total he drinks 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 glasses of water per day.\n2. Since there are 7 days in a week, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day for 7 days, so he drinks 3 * 7 = 21 glasses of water in a week.\n3. However, on weekends, he drinks soda instead of water during tea time, so he doesn't drink water during 2 days of the week (Saturday and Sunday).\n4. This means he drinks water for 5 days of the week, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which is 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water in 5 days.\n5.

The boat started with 2 liters of water per 10-foot section, and it was 64 seconds to reach the target distance.\n2. The boat covered a distance of 64 seconds, which means it traveled 64 seconds * 10 feet/second = 640 feet.\n3. Since the boat had 2 liters of water per 10-foot section, it would have used 640 feet * 2 liters/10 feet = 128 liters of water.\n4. The boat had 2 liters of water initially, so it would have 2 liters - 128 liters = -126 liters of water left.\n5. But wait, the problem says the boat had 2 liters of water initially, not -126 liters! This means the boat had 2 liters of water initially, and it used 128 liters of water, so it would have 2 liters - 128 liters = -126 liters of water left.\n6. The problem asks how much water the boat had when Julia reached the target distance. Since Julia reached the target distance, the boat would have used all the water it had, which means it would have 2 liters - 128 liters = -126 liters of water left.\n\nSo, the answer is: The boat had -126 liters of water when Julia reached the target distance.", "prediction": "126"}

The Brittany camera can take 50 times more pictures than a picture taken with a plane in a wildlife reserve, which means the capacity of the Brittany camera is 50 times the capacity of the plane camera.\n4. The plane camera can take 1800 pictures, so the capacity of the Brittany camera is 1800 x 50 = 90,000 pictures.\n5.

Vijiko vingapi vilikuwa katika kifurushi ambacho Julia alinunua?", "answer": 10, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nJulia started with 3 plastic spoons (from the previous party) and bought 2 new sets of 5 spoons each, so she now has 3 + 2 * 5 = 15 spoons.\n\nShe used 3 spoons to eat her dinner, and then had 15 - 3 = 12 spoons left.\n\nThe question asks how many spoons were in the set that Julia's husband bought. Since Julia had 12 spoons and her husband bought 5 new sets, we can set up the equation:\n\n12 = 5 * x + 3 (where x is the number of spoons in each set)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 12 / 5 - 3\nx = 2.4 - 3\nx = -0.6\nx = 0 (since you can't have a fraction of a spoon)\n\nSo, the set that Julia's husband bought has 0 spoons, which doesn't make sense. This means that Julia's husband didn't buy any new spoons, and the 12 spoons Julia had were already enough for the dinner.\n\nThe answer is: 0", "prediction": "0"}

Dave bought a big bag of chips and ate 10 and 4 more, so he had 10 + 4 = 14 chips left.\n2. The bag was half full, so he had 14 / 2 = 7 chips in the bag.\n3. The story doesn't mention how many chips each person ate, but it says 3 people shared the remaining chips. So, 7 chips were shared among 3 people, which means each person got 7 / 3 = 2.33 chips (round up to 2).\n4. The story says the last person left 2 chips behind, so the person who took the last chips had 2 + 2 = 4 chips.\n5. The question asks how many chips were in the bag when Dave bought it. Since we don't know the total number of chips, we can't give an exact answer. But we can say that the number of chips is at least 4 (since the last person had 4 chips) and at most 7 (since the bag was half full).\n\nSo, the answer is: The number of chips in the bag when Dave bought it is between 4 and 7.", "prediction": "7"}

Ikiwa Zaid analipwa $6000 kila mwezi, bado atakuwa amesalia na pesa ngapi baada ya matumizi yote na michango yote?", "answer": 350, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, so he spends 1/4 * $6000 = $1500 on rent.\n2. He spends 1/3 of his salary on gasoline, so he spends 1/3 * $6000 = $2000 on gasoline.\n3. He spends 1/2 of the remaining amount on his daughter's expenses, so he spends 1/2 * ($6000 - $1500 - $2000) = $1500 on his daughter's expenses.\n4. He gives $700 to his wife to buy groceries and other household items.\n5. In total, he spends $1500 + $2000 + $1500 + $700 = $6000 on all expenses.\n6. Since he earns $6000 per month, he has $6000 - $6000 = $0 left after all expenses.\n\nSo, the answer is: Zaid has $0 left after all expenses.", "prediction": "0"}

The first team has a fast car that can go 55 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters).\n4. The second team's first car can go 60 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second.\n5. The second team's other cars can go 3 seconds faster than the first car, which means they can go 60 - 3 = 57 seconds per kilometer, which is equivalent to 400 meters per second.\n6. Now, let's compare the speeds: 400 meters per second (team 1's fast car) is faster than 400 meters per second (team 2's first car) and 400 meters per second (team 2's second car).\n7.

This is equal to the sum of the eggs laid by the white and black chickens: 10 + 6 = 16 eggs per day\n\nSince Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, but the white and black chickens together lay 16 eggs per day, he must have some eggs that are not accounted for.

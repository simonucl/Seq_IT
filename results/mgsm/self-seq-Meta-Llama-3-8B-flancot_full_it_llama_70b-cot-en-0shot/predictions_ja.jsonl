If their combined age is currently 162, what will Allen's age be in 10 years?\n\nLet's start by using the ratio to find the individual ages of Darel and Allen. Let Darel's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. Since the ratio is 7:11, we can set up the equation:\n\n7x / 11x = 7 / 11\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:\n\nx = 7 / 11\nx = 7/11\nx = 1\n\nSo, Darel's age is 7x = 7(1) = 7 years, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(1) = 11 years.\n\nNow, we know that the combined age of Darel and Allen is currently 162. We can set up the equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n18x = 162\n\nDivide both sides by 18:\n\nx = 162 / 18\nx = 9\n\nSo, Darel's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63 years, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99 years.\n\nNow, we need to find Allen's age in 10 years.

We also know that the number of worker bees is 12 times the number of baby bees, and the number of baby bees is 2 times the number of queen bees.\n\nLet's start with the number of queen bees. Since the number of baby bees is 2 times the number of queen bees, we can set up an equation:\n\nNumber of baby bees = 2 × Number of queen bees\n700 = 2 × Number of queen bees\n\nTo find the number of queen bees, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\nNumber of queen bees = 700 ÷ 2\nNumber of queen bees = 350\n\nNow, we know that the number of baby bees is 2 times the number of queen bees, so we can set up another equation:\n\nNumber of baby bees = 2 × Number of queen bees\nNumber of baby bees = 2 × 350\nNumber of baby bees = 700\n\nWe already know that there are 700 bees in the hive, and we've just found that the number of baby bees is also 700.

He also works as a bartender, earning $10 per hour. If he replaces his game time with his bartending job, how much money will Jordan earn in a week?\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total hours Jordan works in a week:\nJordan works 1 hour as a bartender, 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). So, the total hours he works in a week is:\n1 hour/day × 5 days/week = 5 hours/week\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total earnings from bartending:\nJordan earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from bartending in a week are:\n$10/hour × 5 hours/week = $50/week\n\nStep 3: Compare with the earnings from playing games:\nJordan plays games for 2 hours a day, which means he plays for:\n2 hours/day × 5 days/week = 10 hours/week\n\nSince he earns $0 per hour from playing games, his earnings from playing games in a week are:\n$0/hour × 10 hours/week = $0/week\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total earnings:\nAdd the earnings from bartending and playing games:\n$50/week (bartending) + $0/week (playing games) = $50/week\n\nTherefore, Jordan earns $50 per week if he replaces his game time with his bartending job.", "prediction": "50"}

{"question": "ジョンには10ヘクタールのパイナップル農場がある。1ヘクタールあたり100個のパイナップルがある。ジョンは3か月ごとにパイナップルを収穫できる。ジョンは年にいくつのパイナップルを収穫できる？", "answer": 4000, "model_output": " John can harvest 3 pineapples per year.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. The question states that John has a 10-hectare pineapple farm.\n2. The question also states that there are 100 pineapples per hectare.\n3. To find the total number of pineapples, we can multiply the area of the farm (10 hectares) by the number of pineapples per hectare (100 pineapples/ha): 10 hectares x 100 pineapples/ha = 1000 pineapples.\n4. The question also states that John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. To find the number of harvests in a year, we can divide the total number of pineapples (1000) by the number of months between harvests (3): 1000 pineapples ÷ 3 months = 333.33 pineapples/month.\n5. Since we want to find the number of pineapples harvested in a year, we can multiply the number of pineapples harvested per month by the number of months in a year (12): 333.33 pineapples/month x 12 months/year = 4,000 pineapples/year.\n6. However, the question asks for the number of pineapples harvested per year, not the total number of pineapples on the farm. Since we've already found the total number of pineapples, we can subtract the number of pineapples harvested per year from the total number of pineapples to find the number of pineapples left: 1000 pineapples - 4,000 pineapples/year = -3,000 pineapples/year.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is that John can harvest 3 pineapples per year.", "prediction": "3"}

To buy the jacket and shoes, she needs $50, but she only has $28. So, she still needs $50 - $28 = $22.\n6. Since she earns $4 per hour by mowing the lawn, she needs to do $22 / $4 = 5.5 hours of mowing the lawn to earn the remaining $22.\n\nTherefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 2 times (5.5 hours each time) to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.", "prediction": "5.5"}

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.\n\nIf Jerry has more white chickens than red chickens by 2, we can let's say the number of white chickens is x and the number of red chickens is x-2.

The large pool had 2x - 2x = 0 gallons of water (since it leaks 2 gallons per minute).\n\nNow, the large pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool.

{"question": "36匹のペンギンが雪の中で日光浴しています。うち3分の1が水にもぐり泳ぎ始めます。もう3分の1は洞窟に入り食料を食べます。まだ日光浴しているペンギンは何匹いますか？", "answer": 12, "model_output": " 36 - (3/4) - (3/4) = 36 - 9 - 9 = 18\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. 36匹のペンギンが雪の中で日光浴しています: This means 36 penguins are taking a sunbath in the snow.\n2. うち3分の1が水にもぐり泳ぎ始めます: This means 1/3 of the penguins (or 12 penguins) are going to swim in the water.\n3. もう3分の1は洞窟に入り食料を食べます: This means another 1/3 of the penguins (or 12 penguins) are going to enter a cave to eat food.\n4. まだ日光浴しているペンギンは何匹いますか?: This question is asking how many penguins are still taking a sunbath.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to subtract the number of penguins that have gone to swim or eat from the total number of penguins. So, we subtract 12 (swimming penguins) and 12 (eating penguins) from 36 (total penguins): 36 - 12 - 12 = 18. Therefore, 18 penguins are still taking a sunbath.", "prediction": "18"}
{"question": "スティーブはもっとトマトを食べようと決意し、自分のチェリートマトの栽培を始めることにしました。彼はガールフレンドの2倍の量のトマトを食べます。彼は1日あたり6個のトマトを食べます。1つのつるから1週間あたり3つのトマトを作れるとした場合、スティーブは何本のつるが必要でしょうか？", "answer": 21, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step in English.\n\nThe problem states that Steve wants to eat more tomatoes and decides to start cultivating his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day. If one stem produces 3 tomatoes per week, how many stems does Steve need?\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n\n1. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.\n2. He eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, so he eats 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes per day.\n3. Since one stem produces 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs to produce 12 tomatoes per day, which is equivalent to 12 / 3 = 4 tomatoes per week.\n4. Therefore, Steve needs 4 / 3 = 1.33 stems per week, but since you can't have a fraction of a stem, he needs 2 stems per week.\n\nSo, Steve needs 2 stems to produce enough tomatoes to meet his daily consumption.", "prediction": "2"}

The question asks how many cups of feed Wendy needs to give to the chickens in the last meal of the day, when the chicken population is 20.\n\n3. Since the total amount of feed given to the chickens in a day is 60 cups, and the question asks for the amount of feed needed in the last meal of the day, we can divide the total amount of feed by the number of meals given in a day (2 meals: 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the evening).\n\n4. So, the amount of feed needed in the last meal of the day is:\n60 cups/day ÷ 2 meals/day = 30 cups/meal\n\n5. Since the question asks for the amount of feed needed in the last meal of the day, which is the 2nd meal, we need to divide the amount of feed needed per meal by 2:\n30 cups/meal ÷ 2 = 15 cups/meal × 2 = 30 cups/meal × 1/2 = 15 cups/meal × 1/2 = 5 cups\n\nTherefore, Wendy needs to give 5 cups of mixed chicken feed to the chickens in the last meal of the day.", "prediction": "5"}

Then, she reduces her speed to 5 miles per hour, so in the next 4 hours (since she's been running for 3 hours already), she can run 4 hours x 5 miles/hour = 20 miles.\n3. In total, she can run 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles in 7 hours.\n4. Since the question asks for the distance in miles, not kilometers, we need to convert the result to miles. 50 kilometers = 50,000 meters, and 1 mile = 1,609 meters, so we can convert the result to miles: 50,000 meters ÷ 1,609 meters/mile = 31 miles.\n5. However, the question asks for the distance in miles, not kilometers, so we need to subtract the initial distance: 31 miles - 30 miles = 1 mile.\n6.

The question states that Sandra is the owner of a florist shop and is unhappy with Fred's failure to deliver the ordered flowers.\n2. The question provides the information that Sandra ordered 4 times as many white carnations as red roses, and 5 times as many pink peonies as white carnations.\n3. The question also states that Sandra threatened to switch to a new supplier if the red roses are not delivered by 5 pm.\n4. To keep Sandra's business, Fred needs to deliver the same number of red roses as Sandra ordered, which is 4 times the number of white carnations (since Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations).\n5. The number of white carnations is not specified, but we can infer that it is 1/4 of the number of red roses. Let's assume the number of white carnations is x. Then, the number of red roses is 4x.\n6. Since Sandra ordered 5 times as many pink peonies as white carnations, the number of pink peonies is 5x.\n7. The total number of flowers ordered is the sum of the number of red roses, white carnations, and pink peonies: 4x + x + 5x = 10x.\n8. The question states that Sandra ordered 200 branches of pink peonies, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200.\n9. Solving for x, we get x = 40.\n10. Since the number of white carnations is x = 40, the number of red roses is 4x = 4(40) = 1600.\n11. However, the question asks for the number of branches of red roses, not the number of individual flowers. Since each branch typically consists of multiple flowers, we can assume that the number of branches is a fraction of the total number of flowers. Let's assume the number of branches is 1/4 of the number of flowers, which is a reasonable assumption.\n12. Then, the number of branches of red roses is (1/4) × 1600 = 400.\n13. However, the question asks for the exact number of branches, not a fraction. To find the exact number, we can divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per branch. Let's assume 10 flowers per branch, which is a reasonable assumption.\n14. Then, the number of branches is 1600 ÷ 10 = 160.\n15. Finally, the question asks for the number of branches of red roses, which is 4 times the number of white carnations. Since the number of white carnations is 40, the number of branches of red roses is 4(40) = 1600.\n16. However, the question asks for the exact number of branches, not the total number of flowers. To find the exact number, we can divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per branch. Let's assume 10 flowers per branch, which is a reasonable assumption.\n17.

The farmer sells the wheat to the businessman at $20 per bag, so the businessman buys x bags of wheat.\n2. The cost of transporting each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse is $2 per bag, so the total cost of transportation is 2x bags.\n3. The businessman sells the wheat at $30 per bag, so he sells x bags of wheat.\n4. The total profit is $400, which is the difference between the selling price and the buying price, minus the transportation cost.\n5. The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 30x - 20x - 2x = 400\n6. Combine like terms: 8x = 400\n7. Divide both sides by 8: x = 50\n8. Since the businessman buys each bag of wheat for $20 and sells it for $30, he makes a profit of $10 per bag (30 - 20 = 10).\n9. To find the number of bags sold, divide the total profit by the profit per bag: 400 / 10 = 40\n10.

{"question": "迈克曾是 5 个人的笔友。他和其中 2 个不再是笔友了。他们每个人每周寄 2 封 5 页长的信。他以相同的方式回应。他每 6 分钟能写一页。他一周花多少小时写信？", "answer": 3, "model_output": " 12 hours\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Mike used to be pen pals with 5 people, but now he's only pen pals with 3 of them (since 2 of them are no longer pen pals).\n2. Each of the remaining 3 pen pals sends Mike 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long.\n3. So, in total, Mike receives 2 letters per week, and each letter has 5 pages.\n4. To respond to these letters, Mike writes the same number of letters per week (2) and each letter has the same number of pages (5).\n5. Since Mike can write 1 page per 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time it takes him to write 2 letters per week with 5 pages each:\n\n2 letters/week × 5 pages/letter = 10 pages/week\nTime to write 10 pages/week = 10 pages/week × (1 minute/6) = 10/6 minutes/week\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours:\n\n10/6 minutes/week × 60 minutes/hour = 10 hours/week\n\nSo, Mike spends 12 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals.", "prediction": "12"}

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and she works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week. So, the total cost of makeup for 1 week is:\n$250/hour × 6 hours/day × 4 days/week = $6,000/week\n2. The movie takes 5 weeks to complete, so the total cost of makeup for the entire movie is:\n$6,000/week × 5 weeks = $30,000\n3. The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, which means she reduces the cost by 10%. So, the final cost after discount is:\n$30,000 - 10% = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000\n4. The question asks how much money 珍 paid, but the calculation above shows the total cost of makeup for the movie, not what 珍 paid. However, we can infer that 珍 paid the total cost minus any discounts or fees, so the answer is:\n$27,000 (total cost) - $0 (no additional fees or discounts) = $27,000 = $10,000 (approximately)", "prediction": "10000"}

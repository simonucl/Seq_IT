They all sell their eggs at the market. How much money does Janet earn daily at the market?\"\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily earnings:\n\n* Janet sells 16 eggs at $2 each, so she earns $2 x 16 = $32 per day.\n* Her 3 friends also sell 16 eggs each, so they earn $32 each. In total, they earn $32 x 3 = $96 per day.\n* Since they all sell at the same price, they will split the total earnings. So, Janet's share of the earnings is $96 ÷ 4 = $24 per day.\n\nTherefore, Janet earns $24 per day at the market.", "prediction": "24"}

She pours some of the water into another container with a capacity of 24 liters, but we don't know how much water she pours. Let's call the amount of water she pours \"x\".\n\nWe know that the amount of water in the first container is 10 liters, and the amount of water in the second container is x liters. So, the amount of water left in the first container is 15 - x liters (since she poured x liters into the second container).\n\nWe are also told that the amount of water in the second container is 24 liters, and the amount of water in the first container is 10 liters.

Now, let's find the amount of water in the second container. We know that the amount of water in the second container is 24 liters, and she poured 14 liters into it. So, the amount of water in the second container is 24 - 14 = 10 liters.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of water in the first container.

The book was sold for $19.50.\n2. This is after a 25% discount, which means we need to find 25% of the original price and subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price.\n\nTo find 25% of the original price, we can multiply the original price by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%).\n\nLet's call the original price \"x\". Then, 25% of x is x × 0.25.\n\nThe discounted price is x - (x × 0.25) = x - 0.25x = 0.75x.\n\nWe know that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:\n\n0.75x = 19.50\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:\n\nx = 19.50 ÷ 0.75\nx = $26\n\nSo, the original price of the book was $26.\n\nNow, let's answer the question in Swahili:\n\n\"Kyle alinunua kitabu kilichonunuliwa zaidi mwaka jana kwa $19.50.

A pound of cookie dough costs $10.00. To make 1 cookie, Charlie spends $10.00 / 10 cookies = $1.00 per cookie.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: Charlie buys 1 pound of cookie dough for $10.00 and produces 10 cookies. He then sells each cookie for $2.00, so he gets 10 cookies x $2.00 = $20.00.\n\nSince Charlie spent $10.00 to produce 10 cookies, his profit is $20.00 - $10.00 = $10.00.\n\nTo find the total profit, we need to multiply the profit by the number of cookies he can produce with 1 pound of cookie dough, which is 10 cookies. So, the total profit is $10.00 x 10 cookies = $100.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $100.00.", "prediction": "100.00"}

Sophia's car can hold 12 gallons of gasoline, according to the car's manual.\n2. She has already used 4 gallons of gasoline, as she drove 100 miles since the last time she filled up.\n3. To find out how many miles she can drive with 1 gallon of gasoline, we need to divide the total distance she can drive with 12 gallons (100 miles) by the number of gallons she has used so far (4 gallons).\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n100 miles ÷ 12 gallons = 8.33 miles per gallon\n\nSince Sophia has already used 4 gallons, she can drive for:\n\n8.33 miles per gallon × 1 gallon = 8.33 miles\n\nSo, Sophia can drive for 8.33 miles using 1 gallon of gasoline. However, since the question asks for the distance in whole numbers, we can round this value to 100 miles, which is the distance she drove since the last time she filled up.", "prediction": "100"}

This means that if Harald sold x records, Marilyn sold x + 10 records.\n\nWe know that together they sold a total of 88,000 records. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 10) = 88,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 10 = 88,000\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n2x = 88,000 - 10\n2x = 88,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 44,000\n\nSo Harald sold 44,000 records.\n\nNow, we can find out how many records Marilyn sold by adding 10 to Harald's sales:\n\nMarilyn's sales = Harald's sales + 10\n= 44,000 + 10\n= 44,010\n\nTherefore, Marilyn sold 44,010 records.", "prediction": "44010"}

The total cost of the goods is not given, but we know that the total cost is 50% more than the cost of the socks and shoes.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost of the socks and shoes:\n\n2 x 4 x 10 pairs of socks = 80 pairs\nCost of socks = 80 pairs x $10/pair = $800\n4 x 4 x 10 pairs of shoes = 160 pairs\nCost of shoes = 160 pairs x $16/pair = $2560\n\nTotal cost of socks and shoes = $800 + $2560 = $3360\n\nSince the total cost is 50% more than the cost of socks and shoes, we can calculate the total cost as:\n\nTotal cost = $3360 x 1.5 = $5040\n\nNow, let's assume the total cost of the other items is x. The total amount Sasha spent is the sum of the cost of socks and shoes and the cost of the other items:\n\nTotal amount spent = $3360 + x = $5040\n\nSubtracting the cost of socks and shoes from both sides, we get:\n\nx = $5040 - $3360\nx = $1680\n\nSo, the total cost of the other items is $1680.\n\nTo find the total profit, subtract the total cost from the total amount earned:\n\nTotal profit = Total amount earned - Total cost\n= $1680 - $5040\n= -$3360\n\nTherefore, Sasha made a loss of $3360.", "prediction": "3360"}

{"question": "Tom hupanda miti 10 kila mwaka. Kila mwaka pia huwa anakata miti 2. Anaanza na miti 50. Baada ya miaka 10 30% ya miti inakufa. Amesalia na miti mingapi?", "answer": 91, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step in English.\n\nThe problem states that Tom has 10 kg of miti (which is likely a type of fish) every year. In addition, he also has 2 kg of miti that he catches every year. So, in total, Tom has 10 kg + 2 kg = 12 kg of miti every year.\n\nAfter 10 years, 30% of the miti is lost. To find 30% of 12 kg, we can multiply by 0.3: 12 kg x 0.3 = 3.6 kg. So, after 10 years, Tom has 12 kg - 3.6 kg = 8.4 kg of miti.\n\nThe question asks how many miti Tom has after 10 years. Since we know he has 8.4 kg of miti, and we want to find out how many miti he has, we need to know the weight of one miti. Let's assume the weight of one miti is 1 kg (this is a reasonable assumption, as it's a common unit of measurement for fish).\n\nIf the weight of one miti is 1 kg, then Tom has 8.4 kg / 1 kg = 8.4 miti after 10 years.\n\nSo, the answer is: Tom has 8.4 miti after 10 years.", "prediction": "10"}

The number of eggs laid by each type of chicken per day is given as:\n\n* \"Kuku wekundu\" lays 3 eggs per day\n* \"Kuku weupe\" lays 5 eggs per day\n\nSince Jerry has 2 chickens of each type, the total number of eggs laid per day is:\n\n2 x 3 eggs/day (kuku wekundu) + 2 x 5 eggs/day (kuku weupe) = 6 eggs/day\n\nHowever, the problem states that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. This means that the total number of eggs laid per day is equal to the number of eggs collected per day, i.e.:\n\n6 eggs/day (kuku wekundu + kuku weupe) = 42 eggs/day\n\nTo find the number of \"kuku wekundu\" chickens, we can set up an equation:\n\n3 eggs/day (kuku wekundu) x number of kuku wekundu chickens = 42 eggs/day\n\nDivide both sides by 3 eggs/day:\n\nnumber of kuku wekundu chickens = 42 eggs/day ÷ 3 eggs/day\n= 14 chickens\n\nSo, Jerry has 14 \"kuku wekundu\" chickens. Since he has 2 of each type, he has 2 \"kuku weupe\" chickens as well. Therefore, he has a total of:\n\n14 (kuku wekundu) + 2 (kuku weupe) = 16 chickens\n\nof which 14 are \"kuku wekundu\" and 2 are \"kuku weupe\".", "prediction": "2"}
{"question": "Gary anapenda kutembea kwenye ukingo wa mbuga wa ndani, ambao una umbo la mstatili na vipimo vyake ni maili 1.5 kwa maili 6. Ikiwa huwa anatembea maili 3 kwa saa, huwa anatumia saa ngapi kutembea?", "answer": 5, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe question is asking how many hours it takes Gary to walk 3 miles if he walks at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour on the inside track, which is 1.5 miles wide, and 6 miles long, and he wants to walk 3 miles.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n* Gary wants to walk 3 miles.\n* The track is 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long, so he can walk 1.5 miles in one direction and then 6 miles back to the starting point.\n* Since he wants to walk 3 miles, he will walk 1.5 miles in one direction and then 1.5 miles back to the starting point.\n* To find the time it takes to walk 1.5 miles, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.\n* Speed = 1.5 miles per hour (from the problem).\n* Distance = 1.5 miles (the distance he wants to walk in one direction).\n* Time = 1.5 miles / 1.5 miles/hour = 1 hour.\n\nSo, it takes Gary 1 hour to walk 1.5 miles. Since he wants to walk 3 miles, it will take him 2 hours to walk 3 miles (1 hour to walk 1.5 miles and then another hour to walk 1.5 miles back to the starting point).\n\nAnswer: Gary will take 2 hours to walk 3 miles.", "prediction": "3"}

Kidimbwi kidogo kina maji kiasi gani kwa sasa?", "answer": 8, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step in English.\n\nThe problem states that:\n\n1. Jerry has a big bucket and a small bucket.\n2. The big bucket holds 4 times as much water as the small bucket.\n3. Initially, the big bucket had twice as much water as the small bucket.\n4. Now, the big bucket has 4 times more water than the small bucket.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\nInitially, the small bucket had some amount of water, let's call it x. Since the big bucket holds 4 times as much water, the big bucket had 4x water initially.\n\nNow, the big bucket had twice as much water as the small bucket, so it had 2x water initially.\n\nBut then, the big bucket had 4 times more water than the small bucket, so it had 4x water initially.\n\nWe know that the big bucket has 4x water initially, and we want to find out how much water is in the small bucket now.\n\nLet's set up an equation:\n\n4x = x + 2x + 3x (since the big bucket has 4x water initially, and we need to find the total amount of water in the small bucket, which is x + 2x + 3x)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x = 4x\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense, as we have 4x = 4x, which is true. However, we can try to find a solution by using the given information.\n\nLet's try to find the amount of water in the small bucket now:\n\nx = 4x - 2x - 3x\nx = 4x - 5x\nx = -x\n\nSo, the small bucket has -x water now. But wait, we can't have negative water! This means that the problem is not well-defined, and we can't find a solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that we can't determine how much water is in the small bucket now, as the problem is not well-defined.", "prediction": "5"}

Emily is older than Jackson and younger than Corey. If James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year younger than Jackson, how old is Jackson?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's start with the given information. Emily is older than Jackson and younger than Corey. So, Emily is either older than or younger than Jackson. We don't know which. \nNext, we know that James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year younger than Jackson. So, James is either 10 or 11 years old (since he's either 1 year older or 1 year younger than Jackson), and Corey is either 9 or 10 years old (since he's either 1 year older or 1 year younger than James). \nNow, we can use algebra to solve for Jackson's age. Let's call Jackson's age \"x\". We know that Emily is older than Jackson, so x > 0. We also know that James is either 10 or 11 years old, and Corey is either 9 or 10 years old. So, we have two equations:\n- x + 1 = 10 (if James is 10 years old)\n- x + 1 = 11 (if James is 11 years old)\n- x + 1 = 9 (if Corey is 9 years old)\n- x + 1 = 10 (if Corey is 10 years old)\nWe can solve for x by taking the average of these equations:\n- (x + 1 = 10 + x + 1 = 11) / 2 = x + 1 = 10.5\n- (x + 1 = 9 + x + 1 = 10) / 2 = x + 1 = 9.5\nSo, x = 9.5. \nTherefore, Jackson is 9.5 years old.", "prediction": "9.5"}

Every time the boat traveled 10 feet, 2 liters of water would enter. This means the boat was losing 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it traveled. \nTo calculate how much water entered the boat before Julia reached the shore, we need to know how long it took for her to reach the shore. We are given that the shore is 64 seconds away, so we can assume that it took Julia 64 seconds to reach the shore. \nDuring that time, the boat traveled 10 feet every 10 seconds (10 feet / 10 seconds = 10 feet per minute). So the boat traveled 10 feet * 64 seconds = 640 feet (or 192 meters) before Julia reached the shore. \nTherefore, the amount of water that entered the boat before Julia reached the shore is 2 liters * 10 feet * 64 seconds / 10 seconds = 128 liters (or 3.17 gallons).", "prediction": "3.17"}

After 4 years, his salary increases by 40% compared to 4 years ago. If Adrian and Lilia's salaries increase at the same time, and Adrian earned $40,000 4 years ago, what will be their total salaries 4 years later?\n Step-by-Step Answer: \n Lilia's salary is x, and Adrian's salary is 1.3x (30% higher). \n After 4 years, Lilia's salary increases by y, and Adrian's salary increases by 1.4y (40% higher). \n So, 4 years later, Lilia's salary will be x + y, and Adrian's salary will be 1.3x + 1.4y. \n If we assume that both salaries increase by the same amount y, then we have:\n 1.3x + 1.4y = 1.3(x + y) + 1.4y\n 0.07x + 0.06y = 0.06y\n 0.01x = 0.00y\n x = 0.00y\n This means that if Lilia's salary increases by y, Adrian's salary will also increase by y. \n Therefore, if Adrian earned $40,000 4 years ago, and his salary increases by y, then 4 years later he will earn $60,000 (1.4y). \n If Lilia's salary also increases by y, then 4 years later her salary will be 1.3y. \n So, their total salaries 4 years later will be:\n 1.3x + 1.4y + x + y = 2.3x + 2.5y\n = 2.3($40,000) + 2.5y\n = $92,000 + 2.5y\n Therefore, their total salaries 4 years later will be $92,000 if they both receive the same increase, and $60,000 if Adrian receives a higher increase.", "prediction": "60000"}

The team with varying ability would have a total time of 60 + (3 * 3) = 69 seconds (1 runner running 60 seconds, and the following runners running 3 seconds faster than the previous runner).

There are 3 cages with the same number of mice, and each mouse gets 6 hay sticks. There are also 10 cages with one hamster each, and each hamster gets 5 hay sticks. In addition, there is a rabbit hutch with 20 hay sticks for all the rabbits. The hay is not used for any other purpose in this pet shop. If 160 hay sticks are given to the rodents, how many mice are in each cage?\n Step-by-Step Answer: There are 3 cages with 6 hay sticks each, so 3 * 6 = 18 hay sticks per cage. There are 10 cages with 5 hay sticks each, so 10 * 5 = 50 hay sticks per cage. There are 20 hay sticks in the rabbit hutch. In total, 18 + 50 + 20 = 88 hay sticks are given to the rodents. If 160 hay sticks are given, then 88 - 160 = -72 hay sticks are missing. To answer the question, we need to know how many hay sticks are in each cage. We can assume that the number of hay sticks per cage is the same. Let's call this number \"x\". We know that 18x + 50x + 20 = 88, so 18x + 50x + 20 - 88 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 4.5. However, we can't have a fraction of a mouse, so we need to round up or down. If we round up, we get 5 mice per cage, and 5 * 6 = 30 hay sticks per cage. If we round down, we get 4 mice per cage, and 4 * 6 = 24 hay sticks per cage. Therefore, we can't give out 160 hay sticks if there are 4 or 5 mice per cage.", "prediction": "5"}

For breakfast, he ate 3 omelets, and each had more cheese than the sandwiches, so he ate 3 * 2 = 6 slices of cheese. Finally, he ate 8 slices of cheese for mac and cheese. So in total, he ate 14 + 6 + 8 = 28 slices of cheese.\nThe Answer is: 28", "prediction": "28"}

If Sarah already has $10 saved up, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Sarah wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and shoes that cost $20 each, so the total cost is $30 + $20 + $20 = $70. She earned $5 each time she helps out with the neighbor's children, so she can earn $5 * 4 = $20. Her parents will give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she can earn $4 * 4 = $16.

She earned $20 from helping out with the neighbor's children and $16 from mowing the lawn, so she needs to earn $24 from mowing the lawn.

One gallon of water is lost per minute. Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now, the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. How much water is in the smaller pool now?\n Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that the smaller pool has x gallons of water. Then the larger pool has 2x gallons of water (because it had twice as much water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago). \n Now, the larger pool has 4x gallons of water (because it has four times as much water as the smaller pool now). \n So, we know that the smaller pool has x gallons of water and the larger pool has 4x gallons of water. \n We also know that the smaller pool has a leak that loses 4 gallons of water per minute, and the larger pool has a leak that loses 4x gallons of water per minute. \n After 4 minutes, the smaller pool has lost 4x - x = 3x gallons of water, and the larger pool has lost 4x - 4x = 0 gallons of water. \n Therefore, the smaller pool has 3x - 4x = -x gallons of water left, which is negative. This doesn't make sense. \n So, we need to adjust our assumptions. Let's assume that the smaller pool has y gallons of water. Then the larger pool has 2y gallons of water (because it had twice as much water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago). \n Now, the larger pool has 4y gallons of water (because it has four times as much water as the smaller pool now). \n So, we know that the smaller pool has y gallons of water and the larger pool has 4y gallons of water. \n We also know that the smaller pool has a leak that loses 4 gallons of water per minute, and the larger pool has a leak that loses 4y gallons of water per minute. \n After 4 minutes, the smaller pool has lost 4y - y = 3y gallons of water, and the larger pool has lost 4y - 4y = 0 gallons of water. \n Therefore, the smaller pool has 3y - 4y = -y gallons of water left, which is negative. \n So, we need to adjust our assumptions again. Let's assume that the smaller pool has z gallons of water. Then the larger pool has 2z gallons of water (because it had twice as much water as the smaller pool 4 minutes ago). \n Now, the larger pool has 4z gallons of water (because it has four times as much water as the smaller pool now). \n So, we know that the smaller pool has z gallons of water and the larger pool has 4z gallons of water. \n We also know that the smaller pool has a leak that loses 4 gallons of water per minute, and the larger pool has a leak that loses 4z gallons of water per minute. \n After 4 minutes, the smaller pool has lost 4z - z = 3z gallons of water, and the larger pool has lost 4z - 4z = 0 gallons of water. \n Therefore, the smaller pool has 3z - 4z = -z gallons of water left, which is negative. \n So, we can't find a solution using algebra.

In the first year, it will produce 7 oranges, which will earn $1.5 each, so the total income will be 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. The cost of watering and pruning the tree each year is $3.

What is the faster pace (in miles per hour) she needs to walk for the remaining distance to maintain an average pace of 4 miles per hour? \nStep-by-Step Answer: To maintain an average pace of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the total distance of 12 miles within 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles, 1 hour for the next 2 miles, and 1 hour for the remaining 6 miles).

To make each bottle 15 ounces, we need to add 5 ounces of water to each bottle, so there are 10 * 5 = 50 ounces of water needed. However, one bottle is missing, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of bottles, so there are 15 - 1 = 14 bottles in total.

If she can fly 3 miles in an hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she uses one hour of running and two hours of walking?\nStep-by-Step Answer: \nIf she runs at 4 times her normal walking speed, she can cover 4 times the distance she would cover by walking. So in one hour of running, she can cover 4 times the distance she would cover by walking in one hour. \nIf she walks at 2 times her normal walking speed, she can cover 2 times the distance she would cover by walking. So in two hours of walking, she can cover 2 times the distance she would cover by walking in two hours. \nTherefore, in six hours, she can cover 4 times the distance she would cover by walking in one hour (from running) + 2 times the distance she would cover by walking in two hours (from walking) = 6 times the distance she would cover by walking in six hours. \nIf she flies at half her running speed, she can cover half the distance she would cover by running. So in one hour of flying, she can cover half the distance she would cover by running in one hour. \nTherefore, in six hours, she can cover 3 miles (from flying) + 4 times the distance she would cover by walking in one hour (from running) + 2 times the distance she would cover by walking in two hours (from walking) = 6 times the distance she would cover by walking in six hours. \nSo, she can travel approximately 6 times 6 = 54 miles in six hours if she uses one hour of running and two hours of walking. \nThe Answer is: 54 miles.", "prediction": "54"}

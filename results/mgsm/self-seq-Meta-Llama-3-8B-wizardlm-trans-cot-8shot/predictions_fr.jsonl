However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that cost $5 less than the boots. One of the high heels pairs costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. What is the price of the boots in dollars?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the price of the boots is x dollars. We know that the high heels pairs cost $5 less than the boots, so they cost x - 5 dollars each. We also know that one of the high heels pairs costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the two high heels pairs cost x - 5 + 33 = 2x - 5 dollars in total. \nWe are told that the boots and the two high heels pairs cost the same, so we can set up an equation: \nx + (x - 5) + 2x - 5 = x + 2x - 5 \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n3x - 5 = 0 \nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get: \n15x - 25 = 0 \nDividing both sides by 5, we get: \n3x - 5 = 0 \nAdding 5 to both sides, we get: \n3x = 0 \nDividing both sides by 3, we get: \nx = 0 \nTherefore, the price of the boots is 0 dollars. \nThe Answer is: 0", "prediction": "0"}

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If Jacques is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, what is the age of Jackson?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's start with the given information. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is 5 years more than Jackson's. Therefore, if Amy is x years old, Jackson is x-5 years old. Similarly, if Corey is 2 years younger than Amy, then Corey is x-2 years old. \nNow, we know that Jacques is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Jacques is x-1 years old. \nWe can use algebra to solve for x, the age of Amy, Jackson, and Corey. Let's start with the equation:\nx - 5 = Jackson's age\nx - 2 = Corey's age\nx - 1 = Jacques' age\nWe can solve for x by adding the three equations:\nx - 5 + x - 2 + x - 1 = 3x - 7 = 0\n3x = 7\nx = 7/3\nSo, Amy is 7/3 years old, Jackson is 2 years old, and Corey is 5 years old. \nThe Answer is: Jackson is 2 years old.", "prediction": "2"}

But after a change in his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds, what is, in seconds, the time it takes for Gerald to run the 400 meters hurdles after his new diet? \nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Lee's time of 38 seconds is the new time for Gerald to beat. To find out how much time Gerald needs to improve, we need to calculate the time he would have run the race before the change in diet. \nIf Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds, he runs at an average speed of 8 meters per second (400 meters divided by 50 seconds). \nIf Gerald runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds after his new diet, he runs at an average speed of 8.1 meters per second (an improvement of 10% from his previous speed). \nTo calculate the time it takes for Gerald to run the 400 meters hurdles after his new diet, we can use the following formula: \nNew time = Old time * (1 + Percentage/100) \nPlugging in the values, we get: \nNew time = 38 * (1 + 10/100) \nNew time = 42.4 seconds \nTherefore, the time it takes for Gerald to run the 400 meters hurdles after his new diet is 42.4 seconds.", "prediction": "42.4"}

If we count 2 cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, how many domestic animals are there in total in the neighborhood?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that there are x dogs in the neighborhood. Then, there are 2x cats (2 cats for every dog). So the total number of dogs and cats is 60 + 2x. The population of pet rabbits is 12 units less than that of dogs and cats, so it is 60 + 2x - 12. Therefore, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is 60 + 2x. We just need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. We can't solve for x directly, but we can use trial and error or a graphing calculator to find an approximate value.

Si Jessica veut payer 50 % de plus que le minimum, combien doit-elle payer en un an ?", "answer": 18000, "model_output": " Translation the question into English:\nQuestion: Jessica wonders how much money she needs to pay each month to cover all her debts. The minimum payment for her student loan is $300 per month, that for her credit card is $200 per month and that for her mortgage is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she need to pay in a year?\nStep-by-Step Answer: The minimum payment for the student loan is $300 per month, so in a year, it would be 300 * 12 = 3600. The minimum payment for the credit card is $200 per month, so in a year, it would be 200 * 12 = 2400. The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500 per month, so in a year, it would be 500 * 12 = 6000. To pay 50% more than the minimum, Jessica needs to add 50% to each of these payments. So, in a year, she needs to pay 3600 + (50% of 3600) = 5400 for the student loan, 2400 + (50% of 2400) = 3600 for the credit card, and 6000 + (50% of 6000) = 9000 for the mortgage.

Calculate the average age that the three of them will have in three years, if Harriet is currently 21 years old.\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's start with Harriet's age. We know that she has half of Zack's age, so if Zack is x years old, Harriet is x/2 years old. We don't know what Zack's age is, but we know that Harriet is currently 21 years old. So we can set up an equation:\nHarriet's age = x/2 = 21\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 42\nSo Zack is 42 years old. Now we know that Adrian's age is three times greater than Harriet's, so he is 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Finally, we can calculate the average age by adding the three ages and dividing by 3:\nAverage age = (Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3\nAverage age = (63 + 21 + 42) / 3\nAverage age = 22.5 years old\nSo in three years, the average age of the three of them will be 22.5 years old.", "prediction": "22.5"}

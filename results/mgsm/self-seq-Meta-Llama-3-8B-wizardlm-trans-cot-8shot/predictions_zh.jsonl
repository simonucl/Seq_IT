However, she has to choose between the shoes and two pairs of heels that are slightly cheaper than the shoes. If one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice that price. What is the price of the shoes?\n Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the price of the shoes is x. If the heels cost twice as much as the shoes, then the price of the heels is 2x. If the shoes and the heels are only $5 cheaper than the heels, then the shoes and the heels cost $33 - 5 = $28 and $66 respectively. \n Therefore, the shoes cost $28 - x = $5 and the heels cost $66 - 2x = $30. \n We can solve for x by setting the two equations equal to each other: \n $28 - x = $5 \n $66 - 2x = $30 \n Adding the two equations, we get: \n $94 - 3x = $35 \n Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: \n $279 - 9x = $105 \n Dividing both sides by 9, we get: \n $31.11 - x = $11.67 \n Adding $5 to both sides, we get: \n $36.11 - x = $16.67 \n Therefore, the shoes cost $36.11. \n The Answer is: $36.11", "prediction": "36.11"}

Their current ages add up to 18 years. If we want to find out what their ages will be 10 years from now, we need to multiply their current ages by a factor of 10. \nSo, Darryl's age will be 7 * 10 + 7 = 77 years old, and Aaron's age will be 11 * 10 + 11 = 121 years old. \nThe ratio of their ages will be 77:121, which simplifies to 11:18. \nThe Answer is: 11:18", "prediction": "18"}

We know that Ellen's collection has more pieces than half of the jewelry pieces in the collection, so Ellen's collection has 40/2 + 5 = 20 jewelry pieces. We also know that Swindon's collection has fewer pieces than Ellen's collection, so x < 20. \nWe can set up an equation to solve for x:\nx + 2 = 20 (since Ellen's collection has 2 more pieces than Swindon's collection)\nx = 18 (since 18 + 2 = 20)\nTherefore, Swindon's jewelry collection has 18 jewelry pieces.", "prediction": "18"}

If she sells all of them, how much profit will she make? \nStep-by-Step Answer: \n Summer bought the wood at a lower price, but now the price has increased by 50%, so she can sell them at a higher price. \n To calculate her profit, we need to first find out how much she paid for the wood. \n For the 2 x 4 x 10 wood boards, she bought them for $10 each, so the total cost is 10 x 10 = $100. \n For the 4 x 4 x 10 wood boards, she bought them for $16 each, so the total cost is 5 x 16 = $80. \n So the total cost of the wood is $100 + $80 = $180. \n If she sells all of them, she will get 10 x $10 = $100 + 5 x $16 = $80 = $180. \n Therefore, her profit will be $180 - $180 = $0. \nThe Answer is: $0", "prediction": "0"}

Four years later, his salary increases and his income is 40% higher than it was four years ago. If Adrian's and Leila's salaries increase by the same amount, what are their total salaries four years later?\nStep-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Leila's salary increases by x. Then, her salary four years later is 1.4x (because it's 40% higher than it was before). Similarly, Adrian's salary four years later is 1.4 times his original salary. \nSo, we have 1.4x = Leila's salary four years later \nand \n1.4 * 40,000 = Adrian's salary four years later \nWe don't know what Leila's salary is, but we know that it's 70% of Adrian's salary. Therefore, we can write an equation: \nLeila's salary four years later = 0.7 * Adrian's salary four years later \nNow we can substitute the value of Leila's salary four years later with the equation above: \n1.4x = 0.7 * 1.4 * 40,000 \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n1.1x = 48,000 \nx = 43,090.91 \nSo, we know that Leila's salary four years later is: \n0.7 * 1.4 * 40,000 = 28,000 + 43,090.91 = 71,090.91 \nTherefore, their total salaries four years later are: \nAdrian's salary four years later = 1.4 * 40,000 = 56,000 \nLeila's salary four years later = 0.7 * 1.4 * 40,000 = 28,000 + 43,090.91 = 71,090.91 \nThe Answer is: \nAdrian's salary four years later = 56,000 \nLeila's salary four years later = 71,090.91", "prediction": "71090.91"}

The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, while the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. If Jerry's white chickens are two more than his red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?\n Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens and y white chickens. We know that y = x + 2 (because the white chickens are two more than the red chickens). \n We also know that the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so 3x eggs are laid per day by the red chickens. Similarly, the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so 5y eggs are laid per day by the white chickens. \n Therefore, the total number of eggs laid per day is 3x + 5y = 42. \n Substituting y with x+2, we get 3x + 5(x+2) = 42.

Then, the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. \nThe difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium, so the difference is 2x. \nIf the difference in the number of snails is 2x, then the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32 - 2x, and the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4 + 2x. \nWe know that the number of snails in the second aquarium cannot be negative, so 32 - 2x cannot be negative. Therefore, 2x cannot be greater than 28 (the maximum number of snails in the second aquarium). \nIf 2x is 28, then the number of snails in the second aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the first aquarium is 28. \nIf the two aquariums have the same number of fish, then the number of fish in each aquarium is x.

Let's assume that the truck has n boxes, and each box weighs 15 pounds. The total weight of the boxes would be n x 15 = 900n pounds. \nNow, we need to calculate the total weight of the truck and the boxes. The weight of the truck and the boxes would be the sum of the driver's weight and the weight of the empty truck. \nLet's assume that the driver weighs x pounds and the empty truck weighs y pounds. The total weight of the truck and the boxes would be x + y + 900n. \nWe know that the maximum weight that the bridge can support is 5,000 pounds. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of n that satisfies the following inequality: \nx + y + 900n ≤ 5,000 \nWe don't have any information about x and y, so we can't solve this inequality. However, we can solve it if we assume that x = 0 and y = 3,755. \nUnder this assumption, we can solve the inequality: \n0 + 3,755 + 900n ≤ 5,000 \n900n ≤ 1,245 \nn ≤ 13.79 \nSince we can't have a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 13.

On Friday, because it's the weekend, he stays up late and watches two one-hour programs. If he watches a total of seven hours of television, how many half-hour programs does he watch on Wednesday? \nTo solve this problem, we need to figure out how many half-hour programs he watches in total and then subtract the number of half-hour programs he watches on Wednesday from that total. \nLet's start by figuring out how many half-hour programs he watches in total. \nOn Wednesday, he watches several half-hour programs. We know that he watches at least one half-hour program (the one that starts at 7:00 PM) and at most three half-hour programs (one for each time slot). \nIf he watches only one half-hour program on Wednesday, then he watches a total of 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3 hours of television on Wednesday. \nIf he watches two half-hour programs on Wednesday, then he watches a total of 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 4 hours of television on Wednesday. \nIf he watches three half-hour programs on Wednesday, then he watches a total of 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 5 hours of television on Wednesday. \nSince he watches a total of 7 hours of television, he cannot have watched 3, 4, or 5 hours of television on Wednesday. Therefore, he must have watched 2 half-hour programs on Wednesday. \nTherefore, he watches 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 7 hours of television in total. \nSo, he watches 2 half-hour programs on Wednesday.", "prediction": "2"}

We can use this information to set up an equation: \nProfit = Revenue - Cost \nWe can calculate the revenue by multiplying the number of gallons sold by the price per cup: \nRevenue = 20 cups per gallon x 0.50 dollars per cup = 10 dollars per gallon \nWe can calculate the cost by adding the cost of the lemons and sugar: \nCost = 3x + 2x = 5x \nNow, we can substitute the values for Revenue and Cost into the equation: \n25 dollars = 10 dollars per gallon x 20 gallons + 5x \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n25 dollars = 200 dollars + 5x \n5x = 25 dollars \nx = 5 gallons \nSo, they sell 5 gallons of lemonade, which means they use 15 dollars' worth of lemons and 10 dollars' worth of sugar. \nTherefore, they spend a total of 25 dollars to make the lemonade, and they make a profit of 25 dollars.", "prediction": "25"}

{"question": "史蒂夫决定开始吃更多番茄，并决定自己种植小番茄。他吃的是他女朋友的两倍。他每天吃 6 个。如果一根藤蔓每周能结 3 个番茄，他需要多少根藤蔓？", "answer": 21, "model_output": " Steve decides to eat more tomatoes and to grow his own small tomatoes. He eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend. He eats 6 tomatoes per day. If a tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many tomato plants does he need? \nTo solve this problem, we can use a proportion: \nIf Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per week, then Steve eats 6 tomatoes per week (twice as many). \nIf a tomato plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then Steve needs 2 tomato plants per week (since he eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend). \nTherefore, Steve needs 4 tomato plants per week (2 plants x 2 weeks = 4). \nSo, he needs 4 x 3 = 12 tomato plants per month (4 plants per week x 3 weeks per month = 12). \nTherefore, he needs to grow 12 tomato plants in order to meet his daily and weekly tomato consumption.", "prediction": "12"}

{"question": "假设雷蒙德的洗衣量是莎拉的一半，而莎拉的洗衣量是大卫的 4 倍，如果莎拉的洗衣量为 400 磅，则请计算雷蒙德和大卫的洗衣量差数。", "answer": 100, "model_output": " Step-by-Step Answer: Let's start with what we know. We know that Sarah's washing capacity is 4 times as much as David's, so David's washing capacity is 1/4 of Sarah's, which is 1/4 of 400, which is 100 pounds. We also know that Raymond's washing capacity is half of Sarah's, which is half of 400, which is 200 pounds. Therefore, we have two unknowns: David's and Raymond's washing capacities. We can set up an equation to solve for them: David's washing capacity = 1/4 of Sarah's washing capacity, and Raymond's washing capacity = 1/2 of Sarah's washing capacity. Substituting the known value of Sarah's washing capacity, we get: David's washing capacity = 1/4 of 400 = 100 pounds, and Raymond's washing capacity = 1/2 of 400 = 200 pounds. Therefore, David's and Raymond's washing capacities differ by 100 pounds.", "prediction": "100"}

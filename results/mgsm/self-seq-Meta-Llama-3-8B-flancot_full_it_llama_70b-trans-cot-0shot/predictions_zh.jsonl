The question is asking about the profit made by Joshie after renovating his house.\n2. Joshie bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on renovations.\n3. The total cost of the house after renovations is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n4. The question states that the renovation increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value of the house is 1.5 times the original value.\n5. To find the new value, we can multiply the original value by 1.5: $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000.\n6. Since Joshie spent $130,000 on the renovation, he made a profit of $120,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.\n\nTherefore, Joshie made a profit of $120,000 after renovating his house.", "prediction": "120000"}

Wendy gives 3 cups of mixed chicken feed to each of her chickens every day, and she has 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed given to the chickens in a day is:\n3 cups/chicken × 20 chickens = 60 cups/day\n\n2. The question asks how many cups of feed Wendy needs to give to the chickens in the last meal of the day, when the chicken population reaches 20. This means we need to find out how many cups of feed are needed for the remaining 20 chickens.\n\n3. Since Wendy gives 60 cups of feed in a day, and she has already given some feed to the chickens earlier in the day, we need to subtract the amount of feed given earlier from the total amount of feed given in a day:\n60 cups/day - (15 cups in the morning + 25 cups in the evening) = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups\n\n4. However, the question asks for the amount of feed needed in the last meal of the day, which means we need to divide the remaining 20 cups by 2 (since we have 10 chickens in the morning and 10 chickens in the evening):\n20 cups ÷ 2 = 10 cups\n\n5. Since Wendy gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken, we need to find out how many chickens she can feed with the remaining 10 cups of feed:\n10 cups ÷ 3 cups/chicken = 10 cups ÷ 3 = 3.33 chickens\n\n6. Since Wendy has 20 chickens, and she can feed 3.33 chickens with the remaining 10 cups of feed, she needs to give the remaining 20 - 3.33 = 16.67 cups of feed to the chickens in the last meal of the day.\n\n7. Since Wendy can't give a fraction of a cup of feed, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 cups. Therefore, Wendy needs to give 5 cups of feed to the chickens in the last meal of the day.", "prediction": "5"}

{"question": "一根蜡烛每燃烧一小时就融化 2 厘米。一根蜡烛从下午 1:00 燃烧到下午 5:00，会变短多少厘米？", "answer": 8, "model_output": " 4 cm\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. The question asks about the length of a candle that burns for 4 hours.\n2. The candle burns for 4 hours, which means it will burn for 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.\n3. The candle burns 2 cm per hour, so in 240 minutes, it will burn 2 cm/minute x 240 minutes = 480 cm.\n4. Since the candle starts at 1:00 PM and burns for 4 hours, it will burn for 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.\n5. Therefore, the candle will burn 480 cm / 4 hours = 120 cm per hour, and since it burns for 4 hours, it will burn 120 cm x 4 hours = 480 cm.\n6. The question asks for the change in length, so we subtract the original length from the new length: 480 cm - 0 cm = 480 cm, which is the same as the answer 4 cm.\n\nSo, the candle will shorten by 4 cm.", "prediction": "4"}

The problem states that each serving of potato chips has 250 calories, and you want to know how many grams of potato chips you can eat to reach 2,000 calories.\n3. To find out, you need to calculate how many servings of potato chips you can eat to reach 2,000 calories, considering you've already consumed 1,800 calories.\n4. Let's set up an equation: Total calories = Number of servings × Calorie per serving\n5. You want to reach 2,000 calories, so set the equation as: 2,000 = Number of servings × 250\n6. Divide both sides by 250 to get the number of servings: Number of servings = 2,000 ÷ 250 = 8 servings\n7. Since each serving is 300g, you can eat 8 servings × 300g/serving = 2,400g of potato chips.\n8. However, you've already consumed 1,800g, so subtract that from the total amount you can eat: 2,400g - 1,800g = 600g\n9. The question asks for the number of grams of potato chips you can still eat, which is 600g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 200g, as you can eat 600g - 300g (already consumed) = 200g of potato chips.", "prediction": "200"}

The question is asking about the number of segments of metal wire that were cut to support the tomatoes in the garden.\n2. The metal wire is 4 feet long, and it was cut into smaller segments.\n3. Each segment is 6 inches long, which means we need to find out how many 6-inch segments fit into a 4-foot segment.\n4. To do this, we can convert the length of the metal wire from feet to inches: 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n5. Since each segment is 6 inches long, we can divide the total length of the metal wire (48 inches) by the length of each segment (6 inches) to get the number of segments: 48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8 segments.\n6. However, the question asks for the number of segments, not the number of feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 3 segments (4 feet ÷ 1.2 inches/segment), we can divide the number of segments (8) by 3 to get the number of feet: 8 segments ÷ 3 segments/foot = 2.67 feet.\n7. Since the question asks for the number of segments, not the number of feet, we can ignore the result of step 6 and focus on the number of segments, which is 8.\n8. However, the question states that the metal wire was cut into small segments, each 6 inches long. This means we need to find out how many 6-inch segments fit into the original 4-foot segment.\n9. As we did in step 4, we can convert the length of the metal wire from feet to inches: 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n10. Since each segment is 6 inches long, we can divide the total length of the metal wire (48 inches) by the length of each segment (6 inches) to get the number of segments: 48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8 segments.\n11. This is the same result as step 8, which means we have 8 segments of metal wire, each 6 inches long, that were cut from the original 4-foot segment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4, which means the metal wire was cut into 4 segments, each 6 inches long, to support the tomatoes in the garden.", "prediction": "6"}

The question states that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we can multiply the total number of units by the fraction of occupied units: 120 units x (3/4) = 90 units.\n\n3. Since the question asks for the number of unoccupied units, we can subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.\n\nTherefore, 1/4 of the total units in the building are unoccupied.", "prediction": "4"}

The question states that the book bag is too heavy and needs to be reduced by 15 pounds.\n2. The book bag contains 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the comic books is 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n3. The book bag also contains some toys, each weighing 1/2 pound. Let's say the number of toys is x. Then, the total weight of the toys is x x 1/2 = x/2 pounds.\n4. The total weight of the book bag is the sum of the weight of the comic books and the weight of the toys: 7.5 + x/2 = 15 pounds.\n5. To find the number of toys, we can set up an equation: x/2 = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n6. Multiply both sides by 2 to get x = 15 pounds.\n7. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need 15 pounds / (1/2 pound) = 30 pieces of toys.\n8. However, the question asks for the number of toys that need to be removed, not the total number of toys. So, we need to subtract the number of toys that are already in the book bag (30) from the total number of toys: 30 - 30 = 0, which doesn't make sense.

The truck's empty weight (without boxes) is 3,755 pounds, which is already known.\n4. The weight of each box is 15 pounds.\n5. To find the total weight of the boxes, we need to add the weight of the empty truck to the weight of the boxes: 3,755 pounds (truck's empty weight) + 15 pounds (weight of each box) = 4,070 pounds.\n6.

Let's translate the question to English: \"In Dr. Wheat's school, the number of male students is twice the number of female students. If there are 60 female students, and every 5 students has one teacher, how many teachers are there in this school?\"\n\n2. Let's break down the information we have:\n   - There are 60 female students.\n   - The number of male students is twice the number of female students, so we can set up an equation: Male students = 2 × Female students = 2 × 60 = 120.\n\n3. Now, we know that every 5 students has one teacher. To find the total number of teachers, we can divide the total number of students (Male + Female) by 5:\n   - Total students = Male students + Female students = 120 + 60 = 180\n   - Divide by 5: 180 ÷ 5 = 36\n\n4. However, the question asks for the number of teachers, not the total number of students. Since every 5 students has one teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to get the number of teachers:\n   - Total students ÷ 5 = 36 ÷ 5 = 7.2 (round up to 8, but since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we'll round down to 7)\n\n5.

To find the total amount of money Beili receives, we add the initial amount to the weekly amount: $x (initial amount) + $5/week x 8 weeks = $x + $40 = $100.\n4. Since the total amount of money Beili receives is $100, we can set up an equation: $x + $40 = $100.\n5. To solve for $x, we subtract $40 from both sides: $x = $100 - $40 = $60.\n6.

Let's analyze the information: We know the top layer has an area of 16, and the area of each layer is half the area of the next layer down. This means the area of the next layer down is 16 / 2 = 8.\n\n3. Since the area of the next layer down is 8, the area of the layer below that is 8 / 2 = 4.\n\n4. We can see a pattern here: the area of each layer is halving with each layer down. Therefore, the area of the first layer (the base layer) is 4 / 2 = 2, and then it halves again to 2 / 2 = 1.\n\n5.

The problem states that Bobbi's number of electronic games is 3 times fewer than Brian's, minus 5.\n2. Brian has 20 electronic games, but he lost 5 of them, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 electronic games.\n3. Since Bobbi's number of electronic games is 3 times fewer than Brian's, we can set up the equation: Bobbi's games = 3(Brian's games) - 5.\n4. Plugging in the value of Brian's games (15), we get: Bobbi's games = 3(15) - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40.\n5.

We have 20 cars available for rent, and they are divided into three categories: automatic, manual, and semi-automatic.\n2.

There are 4 manual cars, which means we have 4 / 20 = 0.2 of the total cars that are manual.\n4. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars: 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.\n5. Since there are 4 semi-automatic cars out of 20, we can find the percentage by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars: 4 / 20 = 0.2 or 20%.\n6. However, the question asks for the percentage of semi-automatic cars, so we need to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars that are not automatic or manual. This is 4 / (20 - 12 - 4) = 4 / 4 = 1, which is 100% of the semi-automatic cars.

Let's break down the problem: We need to find out how much Huán and Carlos spent on lemons. We know they need 3 lemons for every 1 gallon of lemonade, and they can make 20 cups of lemonade from 1 gallon. So, we can calculate the total number of lemons they need: 3 lemons/gallon × 20 cups/gallon = 60 lemons.\n\n3. We are given that each lemon costs $0.50.

However, the question states that their profit is $25.00, which means they spent $25.00 on other expenses (e.g., sugar, cups, etc.). So, we need to subtract this from the total amount they spent on lemons: $30.00 - $25.00 = $5.00.\n\n5. The question asks how much they spent on lemons, so the answer is $5.00.

The first team is very well-organized, with each member completing the 400m segment in exactly 55 seconds.\n4. The second team is less organized, with the first member taking 60 seconds to complete the 400m segment.\n5. Since the first member of the second team is slower, the remaining members will try to catch up by running faster. However, they will still be slower than the first team, and the gap will be consistent.\n6. To find the total time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the time difference for each member of the second team: 60 seconds (first member) + 3 seconds (each of the remaining members) = 60 + 3*3 = 60 + 9 = 69 seconds.\n7. Therefore, the faster team (the first team) won by 69 seconds - 55 seconds = 14 seconds.

We need to find the probability of getting a number greater than 3 compared to the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers.\n\n2. The probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 1/2 (since there are 3 numbers greater than 3 out of a total of 6 possible outcomes: 4, 5, 6).\n\n3. The probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is 1/4 (since there are 3 pairs of consecutive even numbers out of a total of 6 possible outcomes: 2-2, 2-4, 2-6, 4-4, 4-6, 6-6).\n\n4. To find the difference in probability, we need to subtract the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers from the probability of getting a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\n5.

The rabbits are divided into 1 group of 1 rabbit, so we have 1 x 1 = 1 rabbit.\n6. In total, we have 18 mice + 10 voles + 1 rabbit = 29 rodents.\n7. Since 160 roots of grass are divided among these 29 rodents, we can divide 160 by 29 to get the number of roots of grass per rodent: 160 ÷ 29 = 5.34 roots of grass per rodent.\n8.

The businessman sells the wheat at $30 per bag, and he sells all x bags. So, the total revenue from selling the wheat is 30x bags.\n4. The businessman's total profit is $400, which means the revenue from selling the wheat minus the cost of transportation: 30x - 2x = 400.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 28x = 400.\n6.

Each chocolate stick weighs 40 grams, so the total weight of the chocolate sticks is 40 * 25 = 1000 grams.\n4. We also know that each caramel apple kernel is twice the weight of each chocolate stick, so the total weight of the caramel apple kernels is 80 * 2 = 160 grams.\n5. To find the total weight of the candy bag, we add the weight of the chocolate sticks and the caramel apple kernels: 1000 + 160 = 1160 grams.\n6. However, the question asks for the weight in kilograms, not grams. Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we can divide the total weight by 1000 to get the weight in kilograms: 1160 ÷ 1000 = 1.16 kilograms.\n7. Since the question asks for the weight in kilograms, and the answer is not a whole number, we can round the result to the nearest whole number, which is 1 kilogram.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 40 * 25 + 80 * 2 = 1000 grams, or approximately 1 kilogram.", "prediction": "1"}

The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. If his white chickens are 2 more than his red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, and he has both red and white chickens. Let's say the number of red eggs he collects is x. Then, the number of white eggs he collects is 42 - x (since the total number of eggs is 42, and we've subtracted the number of red eggs).\n\n2. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so the number of red eggs he collects is 3x (since the number of red eggs is x).\n\n3. The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so the number of white eggs he collects is 5x (since the number of white eggs is x).\n\n4. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation: 3x + 5x = 42. Combine like terms: 8x = 42.\n\n5. Divide both sides by 8: x = 42/8 = 5.25. Since x is the number of eggs, and we're looking for the number of chickens, we'll divide by 3 (since 3 eggs are laid per chicken): x/3 = 5.25/3 = 1.75.\n\n6. This means Jerry has 1.75 chickens. Since he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, he has 1.75 + 2 = 3.75 white chickens.\n\n7. Now, we can find the number of red chickens: 3.75 (white chickens) - 2 = 1.75 red chickens.\n\nSo, Jerry has 1.75 red chickens.", "prediction": "1.75"}

Now, the big tank's water level is four times the small tank's. How much water is in the small tank now?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. The big tank's water level is four times the small tank's, which means the small tank's water level is 1/4 of the big tank's.\n2. 4 minutes ago, the big tank's water level was twice the small tank's, which means the small tank's water level was half of the big tank's.\n3. Since the small tank's water level is half of the big tank's, and the big tank's water level has decreased by 1/4, the small tank's water level has decreased by 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n4. The small tank drains at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, it would drain by 4 minutes x 4 gallons/minute = 16 gallons.\n5. Since the small tank's water level decreased by 3/4, it means the water level 4 minutes ago was 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n6. The small tank's water level 4 minutes ago was half of the big tank's, which means the big tank's water level 4 minutes ago was 2 x (1/4) = 1/2.\n7. The big tank drains at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, it would drain by 4 minutes x 4 gallons/minute = 16 gallons.\n8. Since the big tank's water level 4 minutes ago was 1/2, it would drain by 16 gallons, leaving it with 1/2 - 16/16 = 1/2 - 1 = 1/2 gallons.\n9. The small tank's water level is now 1/4 of the big tank's, which means the small tank now has 1/4 x (1/2) = 1/8 gallons of water.\n\nSo, the answer is: The small tank now has 1/8 gallons of water.", "prediction": "8"}

Let's calculate the total number of calories eaten by Su:\nSince 1 cookie contains 200 calories, Su ate 30 cookies, so she consumed 30 x 200 = 6000 calories.\n\n5. Let's calculate the total number of calories eaten by Su's sister:\nSu's sister ate 18 cookies, so she consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.\n\n6. Finally, let's calculate the difference in the number of calories eaten by Su and her sister:\nSu ate 6000 calories, while her sister ate 3600 calories. To find the difference, subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 6000 - 3600 = 2400 calories.\n\nTherefore, Su ate 2400 more calories than her sister.", "prediction": "2400"}

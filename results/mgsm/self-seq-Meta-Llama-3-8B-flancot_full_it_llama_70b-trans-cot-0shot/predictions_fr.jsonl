He then drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours (half an hour), so he covers a distance of:\n30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles\n3. He drives at 80 mph for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of:\n80 mph x 3 hours = 240 miles\n4. In total, he drives for 4 hours, so he covers a distance of:\n180 + 15 + 240 = 435 miles\n5. Since he starts from his home, he has covered a distance of 435 miles in 4 hours, so his speed is:\n435 miles / 4 hours = 108.75 mph (approximately)\n6. Since the question asks for the distance from his home at the end of 4 hours, we need to find the distance covered in the last hour.

The question is asking about the length of a burning candlewick after it has burned for 4 hours (from 13h to 17h).\n2. The candlewick loses 2 centimeters per hour, so we need to calculate the total loss over 4 hours.\n3. Since the candlewick loses 2 centimeters per hour, we can multiply the number of hours by the rate of loss: 4 hours x 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.\n4. Therefore, the candlewick will have lost 8 centimeters after burning for 4 hours.\n5. The question asks for the exact number of centimeters lost, which is 13 centimeters (not 8 centimeters, as stated in the question). This is likely a mistake in the original question, and the correct answer is indeed 13 centimeters.", "prediction": "13"}

The total cost of the order is $50.\n2. The cost of the chicken dish is $12.\n3. The cost of 5 cartons of milk is $3 each, so the total cost of milk is $15.\n4. The cost of 4 apples is $1.50 each, so the total cost of apples is $6.\n5. The total cost of the order so far is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.\n6. The order costs $50, so to find the cost of the pizza boxes, subtract the total cost so far from the total cost: $50 - $33 = $17.\n7. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, divide the remaining cost by $8.50 to find the number of boxes: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.00 (round up to 2, since you can't order a fraction of a box).\n8.

Jean buys twice as many red bow ties as blue bow ties. This means the number of red bow ties is 2 times the number of blue bow ties. Let's call the number of blue bow ties \"x\". Then, the number of red bow ties is 2x.\n\n2. The red bow ties cost 50% more. This means the cost of one red bow tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue bow tie. The cost of one blue bow tie is $40, so the cost of one red bow tie is $40 x 1.5 = $60.\n\n3. Jean spent $200 on the blue bow ties, which cost $40 each. This means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue bow ties.\n\n4. Now, let's find the number of red bow ties.

The question states that Tracy used a 4-foot-long piece of wire to support her tomato plants in her garden.\n2. The wire was then cut into several pieces of 6 inches in length.\n3. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece (6 inches).\n4.

To find the total weight of the band drawings and toys, we can add these weights together:\n\nTotal weight = (1/4 pound) × (number of band drawings) + (1/2 pound) × (number of toys)\n\nWe are not given the exact number of band drawings or toys, but we know that the total weight of the bag is 15 pounds more than the weight of the bag without the extra weight. Let's call the weight of the bag without the extra weight \"W\". Then, the total weight of the bag is W + 15 pounds.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nW + 15 pounds = (1/4 pound) × (number of band drawings) + (1/2 pound) × (number of toys)\n\nTo solve for the number of band drawings and toys, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n4W + 60 pounds = number of band drawings + 2 × number of toys\n\nNow, we can subtract 60 pounds from both sides to get:\n\n4W = number of band drawings + 2 × number of toys - 60 pounds\n\nWe are not given enough information to solve for the number of band drawings and toys, but we can try to find a way to reduce the problem.\n\nLet's assume that Uriah removes 30 band drawings, which means the total weight of the band drawings is 30 × (1/4 pound) = 7.5 pounds. This reduces the total weight of the bag to W - 7.5 pounds.\n\nWe can set up another equation to represent this:\n\nW - 7.5 pounds = (1/2 pound) × (number of toys)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n2W - 15 pounds = number of toys\n\nAdding 15 pounds to both sides, we get:\n\n2W = number of toys + 15 pounds\n\nWe are not given enough information to solve for the number of toys, but we can try to find a way to reduce the problem further.\n\nLet's assume that Uriah removes 15 toys, which means the total weight of the toys is 15 × (1/2 pound) = 7.5 pounds. This reduces the total weight of the bag to W - 7.5 pounds.\n\nWe can set up another equation to represent this:\n\nW - 7.5 pounds = 0 pounds\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n4W - 30 pounds = 0 pounds\n\nAdding 30 pounds to both sides, we get:\n\n4W = 30 pounds\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nW = 7.5 pounds\n\nWe are not given enough information to solve for the number of band drawings and toys, but we can try to find a way to reduce the problem further.\n\nLet's assume that Uriah removes 30 band drawings and 15 toys, which means the total weight of the bag is 7.5 pounds. This is the same as the weight of the bag without the extra weight, so we can conclude that the problem is not solvable.\n\nIn other words, we cannot determine the exact number of band drawings and toys that Uriah needs to remove to reduce the weight of his bag by 15 pounds, as the problem does not provide enough information.", "prediction": "15"}

To find out how many times he can go to the cinema, we need to divide the total amount of money ($42) by the cost of a single movie ($14). This gives us $42 ÷ $14 = 3.\n4. However, since we can't go to the cinema 3 times and have $14 left over, we need to consider that we can't have a fraction of a movie.

{"question": "Une entreprise verse 600 $ par mois à chaque employé. Elle a pour politique d'ajouter 10 % au salaire initial de chacun de ses employés ayant cinq ans d'ancienneté. Si Sylvie vient de passer 5 ans dans l'entreprise en décembre dernier, quel sera son salaire annuel après trois années supplémentaires de service ?", "answer": 9360, "model_output": " $600 + $60 (10% of $600) + $600 = $1260\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The company pays $600 per month to each employee.\n2. After 5 years of service, Sylvie's salary will be $600 per month (no change, since she's already at the 5-year mark).\n3. Since she's been with the company for 5 years, she's eligible for a 10% salary increase. To find 10% of $600, we can multiply by 0.1: $600 x 0.1 = $60.\n4. Add the $60 increase to her current $600 salary: $600 + $60 = $660.\n5. Since the question asks for her salary after 3 additional years of service, we'll multiply her new salary by 3: $660 x 3 = $1980.\n6. Finally, we'll convert the annual salary to a monthly basis by dividing by 12: $1980 ÷ 12 = $165 per month.\n\nSo, Sylvie's salary after 3 years of additional service will be $165 per month, or $1980 per year.", "prediction": "1980"}

If they sold a total of 88,000 copies between them, how many copies did Harald sell?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Marilyn's disc sold 10 times more copies than Harald's disc. This means that if Harald sold x copies, Marilyn sold 10x copies.\n2. The total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000. This means that the sum of the number of copies sold by Marilyn and Harald is equal to 88,000.\n3. Let's set up an equation: Marilyn's copies + Harald's copies = 88,000\n4. We know that Marilyn's copies are 10x, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 10x + x = 88,000\n5. Combine like terms: 11x = 88,000\n6. Divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000\n7. So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Harald sold 8,000 copies.", "prediction": "8000"}

To find the number of girls, we can set up a proportion: (2/3) × 200 = x, where x is the number of girls. Solving for x, we get x = (2/3) × 200 = 80.\n3. Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are scouts, and we've found that there are 80 girls in total. To find the number of girls who are not scouts, we can subtract the number of scouts from the total number of girls: 80 (total girls) - 80 (scouts) = 0 girls who are not scouts.\n4.

The question asks for the number of teaspoons of sugar and water Katy used, given a ratio of 7:13 and a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water.\n2. Let's break down the ratio: 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of water.\n3. To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we can divide the total number of teaspoons (120) by the number of teaspoons of sugar in the ratio (7).\n4. So, we divide 120 by 7 to get the number of teaspoons of sugar: 120 ÷ 7 = 17.43.\n5. Since the ratio is 7:13, we can expect the number of teaspoons of water to be 13 times the number of teaspoons of sugar. To find the number of teaspoons of water, we can multiply the number of teaspoons of sugar by 13: 17.43 × 13 = 227.95.\n6. However, the question asks for the number of teaspoons of sugar, not water.

If Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so let's find 30% of Lylah's salary: 30% of $x = (30/100)$x = $0.3x\n2. Since Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago, and it increased by 30% over the next four years, we can set up an equation: $40,000 + $0.3x = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000 (four years later)\n3. Now, we know Adrien's salary is $52,000 four years later.

Since Jean harvests every 3 months, he will harvest 250 bananas per harvest for 4 harvests in a year. To find the total number of bananas he can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of bananas per harvest by the number of harvests: 250 bananas/harvest x 4 harvests/year = 1,000 bananas/year.\n6.

{"question": "Dave a acheté un gros paquet de frites et en a mangé quatorze avant qu'une mouette affamée ne lui vole le paquet des mains. Lorsque la mouette s'est posée, elle a englouti la moitié de la quantité de frites que Dave avait mangée. Ensuite, trois pigeons ont forcé la mouette à s'éloigner de la nourriture et chacun d'eux a pu manger trois frites. Plus tard, un raton laveur a volé deux tiers des frites restantes. Les fourmis en ont emporté une dernière, abandonnant cinq frites. Combien de frites y avait-il dans le paquet lorsque Dave l'a acheté ?", "answer": 48, "model_output": " Let's break down the story step by step to find the answer.\n\n1. Dave bought a big bag of fries.\n2. He ate 14 fries before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hands.\n3. When the seagull landed, it ate half of the fries Dave had eaten (i.e., 14 / 2 = 7 fries).\n4. Then, three pigeons forced the seagull to move away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries.\n5. Later, a rat stole two-thirds of the remaining fries (i.e., 7 / 3 = 2.33 fries).\n6. Finally, ants took the last fry, leaving 5 fries.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of fries eaten by each creature:\n\n* Dave: 14 fries\n* Seagull: 7 fries\n* Pigeons: 3 x 3 = 9 fries\n* Rat: 2.33 fries\n* Ants: 1 fry\n\nTotal number of fries eaten = 14 + 7 + 9 + 2.33 + 1 = 32.33 fries\n\nSince the story doesn't mention a fraction of a fry, we can round down to 32 fries. This means there were 32 fries in the bag when Dave bought it.", "prediction": "32"}

Jean is 2 years older than Marc, so we can write an equation: Jean's age = Marc's age + 2\n2. Two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. This means that Marc's age 2 years ago was 5 + (half of Jan's age 2 years ago) = 5 + (30/2) = 5 + 15 = 20 years old.\n3. Since Marc is 2 years older than Jean, we can set up another equation: Marc's age = Jean's age + 2\n4.

The less-trained team has four members as well. The first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. So, the total time for the less-trained team up to the first runner is 400 meters in 60 seconds = 60 seconds.\n\n3. The next three runners are 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds to run 400 meters each. The total time for the less-trained team from the second runner onwards is 3 x 400 meters in 57 seconds = 1700 meters in 57 seconds = 57 seconds.\n\n4.

The question is asking about the probability of getting a number greater than 3, rather than an even number, two times in a row, when rolling a 6-faced die (Jerry Lance's die).\n2. To find the probability, we need to identify the possible outcomes of the die and their corresponding probabilities.\n3. A 6-faced die has the following outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each with a probability of 1/6.\n4. Let's consider the outcomes in pairs: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6).\n5. We want to find the probability of getting a number greater than 3, rather than an even number, two times in a row.\n6. For the first roll, we want to avoid even numbers (2, 4, and 6), so we'll consider the outcomes (1, 1), (3, 3), and (5, 5), which have a total probability of (1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6) = 1/2.\n7. For the second roll, we want to avoid even numbers again, so we'll consider the same outcomes as in step 6, which have a total probability of 1/2 again.\n8. Since we want the probability of getting a number greater than 3 two times in a row, we'll multiply the probabilities of the two rolls: (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.\n9.

Let's calculate the total number of pieces of hay distributed to the rats: 3 cages x 6 pieces/cage = 18 pieces of hay.\n6.

Si elle doit payer 165 $ par mois pendant 12 mois, combien d'argent restera-t-il à Janeth d'ici là ?", "answer": 220, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's translate the question to English:\n\n\"Janeth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back with a 10% interest rate. If she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months, how much money will be left for Janeth by then?\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem:\n\n1. Janeth borrowed $2,000.\n2. She has to pay $165 per month for 12 months.\n3. The interest rate is 10% of the original amount, which is $2,000 x 0.10 = $200 per month.\n4. To find out how much Janeth will pay in total, we add the principal amount ($2,000) to the interest amount ($200 per month for 12 months): $2,000 + $200/month x 12 months = $2,400.\n5. Since Janeth has to pay $165 per month, we subtract the total amount she has paid from the total amount she borrowed: $2,000 - $165/month x 12 months = $1,500.\n\nTherefore, by the end of 12 months, Janeth will have $1,500 left.", "prediction": "1500"}

To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per day, we multiply the number of tomatoes his roommate eats per day by 2: 6 tomatoes/day × 2 = 12 tomatoes/day.\n4. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we need to find out how many weeks' worth of tomatoes Steve needs. To do this, we divide the number of tomatoes he eats per day by the number of tomatoes per week: 12 tomatoes/day ÷ 3 tomatoes/week = 4 weeks' worth of tomatoes.\n5.

Jean has twice as many bonbons as Robert. If Jean has 54 bonbons, how many more bonbons does Jean have than Jacques?\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. Jacques has 6 more bonbons than Robert, so we can write an equation: Jacques' bonbons = Robert's bonbons + 6\n2. Jean has twice as many bonbons as Robert, so we can write another equation: Jean's bonbons = 2 × Robert's bonbons\n3.

Now, we can substitute the value of Robert's bonbons from equation 2 into equation 1: Jacques' bonbons = Robert's bonbons + 6\n5. We can also substitute the value of Jean's bonbons from equation 3 into equation 1: Jacques' bonbons = 2 × Robert's bonbons + 6\n6. Since Jacques' bonbons = 54 - 6 = 48, we can set up an equation: 48 = 2 × Robert's bonbons + 6\n7. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us: 42 = 2 × Robert's bonbons\n8. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: Robert's bonbons = 42 ÷ 2 = 21\n9. Now, we can find Jacques' bonbons: Jacques' bonbons = Robert's bonbons + 6 = 21 + 6 = 27\n10. Finally, we can find the number of bonbons Jean has more than Jacques: Jean's bonbons - Jacques' bonbons = 54 - 27 = 27\n\nSo, Jean has 27 more bonbons than Jacques.", "prediction": "27"}
{"question": "Dolly a deux livres. Pandore n'en a qu'un.

Dolly has 2 books.\n2. Pandore has 1 book.\n3. Dolly and Pandore read the books they have, plus the books they borrow from each other. This means they will read a total of 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandore's book) + 2 (books they borrow from each other) = 3 books.\n4. Therefore, at the end, Dolly and Pandore will have read a total of 3 books.", "prediction": "3"}
{"question": "Mike a été le correspondant de 5 personnes et a ensuite cessé de correspondre avec 2 d'entre elles. Les autres envoient chacune 2 lettres de 5 pages toutes les semaines. Il leur répond de la même façon. S'il peut écrire une page toutes les 6 minutes, combien d'heures passe-t-il à écrire par semaine ?", "answer": 3, "model_output": " 24 hours\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Mike corresponds with 5 people, and then stops corresponding with 2 of them, so he's left with 3 people he corresponds with.\n2. Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters of 5 pages each, so Mike receives a total of 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 pages of letters per week.\n3. Since Mike responds to each letter, he needs to write 30 pages of responses per week.\n4. If Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time it takes him to write 30 pages: 30 pages / 1 page per 6 minutes = 30 minutes.\n5. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total time by 60 to get the number of hours: 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours.\n6. However, since the question asks for the number of hours, not half-hours, we can multiply the result by 2: 0.5 hours x 2 = 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, Mike spends 24 hours per week writing responses to the letters he receives.", "prediction": "24"}
{"question": "Jason a un forfait téléphonique de 1 000 minutes par mois.

Combien de minutes reste-t-il à Jason si ce mois compte 30 jours ?", "answer": 250, "model_output": " Jason has 300 minutes left this month.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Jason has a 1,000-minute phone plan per month.\n2. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes each day, which means he uses 15 minutes/day for 30 days (since there are 30 days in the month). This adds up to 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes.\n3. In addition, he made 300 minutes of extra calls to other people this month. This is on top of the 450 minutes he used for his daily calls to his boss.\n4. Therefore, the total number of minutes used this month is 450 minutes (for daily calls) + 300 minutes (for extra calls) = 750 minutes.\n5. Since Jason has a 1,000-minute plan, he has 1,000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes left this month.\n\nHowever, the question asks how many minutes are left, and the answer is 300 minutes, not 250 minutes. This is because the question doesn't consider the 250 minutes used for daily calls to the boss. It only cares about the extra 300 minutes used for calls to other people.", "prediction": "300"}

The question is asking about the number of frites Ginger gave to Griffin.\n2. Let's break down the information we have:\n\t* Griffin had 24 frites initially.\n\t* Kyle took 5 frites, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 frites.\n\t* Billy took twice as many frites as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 frites, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 frites.\n\t* Ginger gave some frites to Griffin, so we need to find out how many.\n\t* Colby took 3 frites less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 frites, leaving Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 frites.\n\t* Since Griffin ended up with 27 frites, we can set up an equation: 24 (initial frites) + x (frites given by Ginger) = 27 (final frites).\n\t* Solving for x, we get x = 3, which means Ginger gave 3 frites to Griffin.", "prediction": "3"}

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the number of fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. Let's identify the given information:\n\t* There are 4 snails in one aquarium.\n\t* There are 32 snails in another aquarium.\n\t* The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the number of fish in the two aquariums.\n\t* The two aquariums contain the same number of fish.\n2.

Since the difference in the number of snails is equal to twice the sum of the number of fish, we can set up an equation:\n\t* 28 = 2 × (fish in aquarium 1 + fish in aquarium 2)\n4. Since the two aquariums contain the same number of fish, we can let the number of fish in each aquarium be x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\t* 28 = 2 × (x + x) = 2 × 2x = 4x\n5.

{"question": "Josh decide intentar remodelar y vender una casa. Compra una casa de $80 000 y luego agrega $50 000 para las reparaciones. Esto aumenta un 150 % el valor de la casa. ¿Cuánto obtuvo de ganancia?", "answer": 70000, "model_output": " $120,000\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Josh buys a house for $80,000.\n2. He adds $50,000 for repairs, which means the total cost of the house now is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n3. The value of the house increases by 150%, which means we need to find 150% of the original value and add it to the current value. To do this, we can multiply the original value by 150% (or 1.5) and then add it to the current value: $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000.\n4. So, the total gain is the difference between the new value of the house ($130,000) and the original value ($80,000), which is $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000.\n5. However, the question asks for the gain in terms of the original value, not the current value. To find the gain in terms of the original value, we can divide the total gain by the original value: $50,000 ÷ $80,000 = $0.625.\n6. Since the question asks for the gain in dollars, not as a fraction, we can multiply the result by the original value: $80,000 x $0.625 = $50,000.\n\nTherefore, Josh's total gain is $120,000.", "prediction": "120000"}

He then turns around to go back home, but gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, which means he doesn't cover any distance during this time.\n3. After the traffic jam, he drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, which means he covers a distance of:\n30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles\n4.

Melanie sold a third of her aspirators at the green house, which means she sold 1/3 of the total number of aspirators she had. Let's call the total number of aspirators \"x\". Then, the number of aspirators she sold at the green house is x/3.\n2. She sold 2 more aspirators at the red house, so she had x - 2 aspirators left after selling at the red house.\n3. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold x/2 - 2 aspirators. So, she had x/2 - 2 - 2 = x/2 - 4 aspirators left after selling at the orange house.\n4. In total, Melanie had 5 aspirators left, which means the sum of the number of aspirators she had at each house is equal to 5. We can set up the equation: x/3 + x - 2 + x/2 - 4 = 5.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x/2 - 2 = 5. Adding 2 to both sides gives us: 3x/2 = 7. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us: x = 7.5. Since x must be an integer, we can round up to get x = 8. However, since we're looking for the number of aspirators she had at the beginning, we need to consider the fact that she sold some aspirators. If she had 8 aspirators, she would have 8 - 1/3 - 2 - 1/2 = 5 aspirators left, which is not the case.

Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour, and then 2 miles in the second hour, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours.\n2. To find her average speed, we divide the total distance by the time: 6 miles ÷ 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.\n3. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to maintain this speed for the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles.\n4. To find the time it takes to cover this remaining distance at 4 miles per hour, we divide the distance by the speed: 6 miles ÷ 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours.\n5. Since she already spent 2 hours walking, she has 1.5 - 2 = 0.5 hours left to cover the remaining distance.\n6. In this remaining time, she needs to cover 6 miles at 4 miles per hour, so we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles ÷ 0.5 hours = 12 miles per hour.\n7. However, this is not the answer because we need to find the speed in miles per hour, not miles per hour squared. So, we divide the speed by 12: 12 miles/hour ÷ 12 = 1 mile/hour, which is not a valid speed. This means we made a mistake somewhere.\n8. Let's re-examine the problem. We know Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour, for a total of 6 miles. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so she needs to cover the remaining 12 - 6 = 6 miles at this speed.\n9. To find the time it takes to cover this remaining distance at 4 miles per hour, we divide the distance by the speed: 6 miles ÷ 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours.\n10.

{"question": "Tengo 10 litros de refresco de naranja que contienen dos tercios de agua y quiero agregarlo a 15 litros de refresco de piña que contienen tres quintos de agua. Pero al verterlo, derramo un litro de refresco de naranja. ¿Cuánta agua hay en los 24 litros restantes?", "answer": 15, "model_output": " 12 litros de agua.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have 10 liters of orange soda with 2/3 water.\n2. We add 15 liters of pineapple soda with 3/5 water to the total.\n3. This makes a total of 10 + 15 = 25 liters of soda.\n4. We then subtract the 1 liter of orange soda that we spilled, leaving us with 25 - 1 = 24 liters of soda.\n5. To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the original sodas and subtract the water that was spilled: (2/3 + 3/5) = 12/15 = 0.8 liters of water.\n6. Since we're asking for the amount of water in 24 liters, we can set up the equation: 24 = 0.8x, where x is the number of liters of water in 24 liters.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 24 / 0.8 = 30 liters of water.\n8. However, this is not correct because we're asking for the amount of water in 24 liters, not the total amount of water. To find the correct answer, we can subtract the amount of water already present in the original sodas: 24 - (2/3 + 3/5) = 24 - 12/15 = 24 - 0.8 = 23.2 liters of water.\n9. Finally, we can see that the question asks for the amount of water in 24 liters, not 23.2 liters. To find the correct answer, we can add 1 liter of water to the result: 23.2 + 1 = 24 liters of water.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of soda.", "prediction": "24"}

The question asks about the length of a candle after burning from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.\n2. The candle burns at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.\n3. To find the total length of time the candle burned, we need to subtract the starting time from the ending time: 5:00 pm - 1:00 pm = 4 hours.\n4. Since the candle burns at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can multiply the total time by the rate: 4 hours × 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.\n5. However, the question asks for the difference in length, so we need to subtract the initial length from the final length: 8 centimeters - 0 centimeters = 8 centimeters.\n6.

Let's translate the question to English: \"The ratio of the ages of Darrell and Allen is 7:11. Calculate Allen's age within 10 years if their total age now is 162.\"\n\n2. We are given the ratio of the ages of Darrell and Allen, which is 7:11. This means that for every 7 years of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 years.\n\n3. We are also given the total age of both Darrell and Allen, which is 162 years.\n\n4. Let's assume Allen's current age is x years. Then, Darrell's age is 162 - x years.\n\n5. Since the ratio of their ages is 7:11, we can set up the equation: 7(Darrell's age) = 11(Allen's age)\n\n6. Substitute the expressions found in step 4 into the equation: 7(162 - x) = 11x\n\n7.

John takes care of 10 dogs.\n2. Each dog takes 30 minutes per day to go for a walk and relieve itself (media hora = 30 minutes).\n3. Since there are 10 dogs, the total time spent walking and taking care of them in a day is 10 dogs x 30 minutes/day = 300 minutes/day.\n4. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the daily time to hours: 300 minutes/day ÷ 60 = 5 hours/day.\n5.

Al final de la noche, después de que los invitados se sirvieran y comieran las porciones de pastel, quedaban 14 porciones. ¿Cuántas porciones se sirvieron los invitados?", "answer": 26, "model_output": " 12 porciones.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. La abuela Jones had 5 pastels de manzana, and she cut each pastel into 8 porciones. So, the total number of porciones is 5 x 8 = 40 porciones.\n\n2. At the end of the night, there were 14 porciones left. This means that some of the porciones were already taken by the guests.\n\n3. To find out how many porciones the guests took, we subtract the number of porciones left (14) from the total number of porciones (40): 40 - 14 = 26 porciones.\n\n4. However, the question asks for the number of porciones served to the guests, not the total number of porciones. Since the abuela cut each pastel into 8 porciones, we need to divide the total number of porciones taken by the guests (26) by 8: 26 ÷ 8 = 3.25.\n\n5. Since we can't have a fraction of a person taking a portion, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3. This means the guests took 3 porciones each.\n\n6. Finally, we need to find the total number of porciones served to the guests. Since there were 5 groups of guests (bomberos), we multiply the number of porciones taken by each guest (3) by the number of groups: 3 x 5 = 15 porciones.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of porciones served, not the total number of porciones taken. Since the abuela had 5 pastels, and each pastel was cut into 8 porciones, we need to divide the total number of porciones served (15) by 8: 15 ÷ 8 = 1.875.\n\n7. Again, we can't have a fraction of a person taking a portion, so we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1. This means the guests took 1 porción each.\n\n8. Since there were 5 groups of guests, we multiply the number of porciones taken by each guest (1) by the number of groups: 1 x 5 = 5 porciones.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 5 porciones, but the question asks for the number of porciones served, not the total number of porciones taken. The correct answer is 12 porciones, since 12 porciones were served to the guests.", "prediction": "12"}

Let's translate the question to English:\n\"According to the nutritional information, a bag of potato chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories?\"\n\n2. Let's break down the problem:\n- We know a 300g bag has 5 servings, so we can find the number of calories in one serving: 300g x 5 servings/300g = 5 servings.\n- We know each serving has 250 calories, so we can find the total number of calories in the bag: 250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.\n- We know the bag has 300g, and we want to find the number of grams of potato chips we can eat. We can use the ratio of calories to grams: 1 calorie/250g = 1/250g.\n- We want to find out how many grams we can eat, given our daily calorie goal of 2000 and the 1800 calories we've already consumed. Let's set up an equation: Total calories - Already consumed calories = Remaining calories, which is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.\n- We can use the ratio of calories to grams to find the number of grams we can eat: 200 calories / (1/250g) = 200 / 250g = 0.8g.\n- Since we can't eat a fraction of a gram, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 30g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30g.", "prediction": "30"}

Charlie can make 10 velas conicas with 1 pound of beeswax, which costs $10.00 in supplies.\n2. Each vela conica is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue from 10 velas conicas is $2.00 x 10 = $20.00.\n3. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00, which is a fixed cost.\n4. The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, so it's $20.00 (revenue) - $10.00 (cost) = $10.00.\n5. Since Charlie makes 10 velas conicas with 1 pound of beeswax, and he wants to know the profit for 20 velas conicas, we can multiply the profit by 2: $10.00 x 2 = $20.00.\n\nTherefore, Charlie's net profit will be $20.00 if he makes and sells 20 velas conicas.", "prediction": "20"}

On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of adhesive notes. At work, she placed one adhesive note on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 adhesive notes left, how many adhesive notes were in the package she bought?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Candice started with 80 adhesive notes in her purse.\n2. She bought a package of adhesive notes at the store, but we don't know how many notes were in the package yet.\n3. At work, she used 1 adhesive note for each of the 220 coffee cups, which means she used a total of 220 adhesive notes.\n4. If she started with 80 adhesive notes and used 220, she should have 80 - 220 = -140 adhesive notes left. But the problem says she has 23 adhesive notes left, which means she has more than -140 adhesive notes. This means she must have had more than 80 adhesive notes in the package she bought.\n5. Let's assume the package had x adhesive notes. Then, Candice started with 80 + x adhesive notes and used 220, leaving her with 23 + x adhesive notes. We can set up the equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23 + x, which simplifies to x = 23 + 80 - 220 = 23 - 140 = -117. But this can't be true, since we know she had more than 80 adhesive notes in the package.\n6. This means the problem has a mistake, and we can't find the exact number of adhesive notes in the package.

John buys twice as many red bow ties as blue bow ties. Let's say he buys x blue bow ties. Then, he buys 2x red bow ties.\n2. The red bow ties cost 50% more than the blue bow ties. This means the cost of 1 red bow tie is 1 + 0.5 = $1.5 more than the cost of 1 blue bow tie.\n3. The blue bow ties cost $40 each, so the total cost of the blue bow ties is x × $40 = $40x.\n4. The total cost of the red bow ties is 2x × $1.5 = $3x.\n5. The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of the blue bow ties and the cost of the red bow ties: $40x + $3x = $43x.\n6. The problem states that John spent $200 on blue bow ties that cost $40 each, so x = $200 / $40 = 5.\n7. Now, we can find the total amount John spent: $43x = $43(5) = $215.\n8.

The question asks how many 6-inch pieces of wire Tracy got from cutting a 4-foot piece of wire into smaller pieces.\n2. To find the number of 6-inch pieces, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.\n3. Since the wire is 4 feet long, and we want to cut it into 6-inch pieces, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches): 48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8.\n4. However, this calculation only tells us how many pieces of wire Tracy can get if she cuts them exactly 6 inches apart.

The distance Sophia has already traveled with the current amount of gasoline is 100 miles.\n4. To find the total distance she can travel with a single tank of gasoline, we need to calculate the distance per gallon of gasoline. According to the manual, the distance per gallon of gasoline is not explicitly stated, but we can assume it's approximately 20-25 miles per gallon (this is a common estimate for cars).\n5. Let's use the average of 22.5 miles per gallon. Then, the distance Sophia can travel with 16 gallons of gasoline is 16 x 22.5 = 360 miles.\n6.

If they sold 88,000 copies together, how many copies did Harald sell?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Marilyn's disc sold 10 times more copies than Harald's, so we can set up a ratio: Marilyn's copies : Harald's copies = 10 : 1\n2. If they sold 88,000 copies together, we can set up an equation: Marilyn's copies + Harald's copies = 88,000\n3. Let's substitute the ratio into the equation: Marilyn's copies = 10Harald's copies\n4. Add Marilyn's copies to both sides of the equation: Marilyn's copies + Harald's copies = 88,000\n5. Simplify the equation: 10Harald's copies + Harald's copies = 88,000\n6. Combine like terms: 11Harald's copies = 88,000\n7. Divide both sides by 11: Harald's copies = 88,000 ÷ 11\n8.

Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter obstacle course is not explicitly stated, but we know Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald initially.\n3. Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which means his new speed is 1.1 times his original speed.\n4. To find Gerald's new time, we can multiply his original time by 1.1: 38 seconds x 1.1 = 42.2 seconds.\n5. Since Lee's time is 38 seconds, and Gerald's new time is 42.2 seconds, we can find the difference: 42.2 seconds - 38 seconds = 4.2 seconds.\n6. However, the question asks for the difference in seconds between Lee's and Gerald's times, so we subtract Lee's time from Gerald's time: 42.2 seconds - 38 seconds = 4.2 seconds.\n7.

Freda uses 16-oz cans of tomatoes, and she uses 32 oz of salsa in the last batch. To find out how many cans she used, we can divide the total amount of salsa (32 oz) by the amount of salsa in each can (16 oz): 32 oz ÷ 16 oz/can = 2 cans.\n2. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so to find the total number of tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes in each can: 2 cans × 3 tomatoes/can = 6 tomatoes.\n3. However, the question states that the tomatoes lose half their volume when prepared into salsa. This means that for every 1 tomato, only 0.5 tomatoes are actually used in the salsa. So, we can divide the total number of tomatoes by 2 to get the number of tomatoes actually used: 6 tomatoes ÷ 2 = 3 tomatoes.\n4. Since the question asks for the number of tomatoes used, not the total number of tomatoes, we can divide the number of tomatoes used by 3 to get the number of tomatoes used per can: 3 tomatoes ÷ 3 cans = 1 tomato/can.\n5.

This means we need to find out how many liters of water entered the boat for the 20 feet of rowing mentioned in the question.\n\n2. Since 2 liters of water enter for every 10 feet, we can set up a simple equation:\n\nLiters of water / 10 feet = 2 liters / 10 feet\n\nTo find the number of liters of water that entered the boat for 20 feet, we can multiply the rate of water entry by the distance:\n\nLiters of water = (2 liters / 10 feet) × 20 feet\nLiters of water = 0.2 liters/foot × 20 feet\nLiters of water = 4 liters\n\nSo, 4 liters of water entered the boat during the 20 feet of rowing.\n\n3. The question also mentions that the boat was 64 seconds away from the shore when Julia started rowing. Since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up another equation to find the total number of liters of water that entered the boat:\n\nTotal liters of water = Liters of water per 20 feet × Total time\nTotal liters of water = 4 liters/20 feet × 64 seconds\nTotal liters of water = 32 liters\n\nTherefore, the boat had 32 liters of water when Julia arrived at the shore.", "prediction": "32"}

{"question": "Ryan planta 2 flores por día en su jardín. ¿Cuántas flores tiene después de 15 días si 5 no crecieron?", "answer": 25, "model_output": " 10 flores\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Ryan plants 2 flowers per day in his garden.\n2. He does this for 15 days.\n3. Since he plants 2 flowers per day, in 15 days, he will plant a total of 2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers.\n4. However, 5 flowers did not grow, so we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.\n5. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers per day, he will have 2 flowers per day for 15 days. To find the total number of flowers, we can multiply the number of flowers per day by the number of days: 2 flowers/day × 15 days = 30 flowers.\n6. But we've already accounted for the 5 flowers that didn't grow, so we don't need to add them back in.\n7. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will have 30 - 5 = 25 flowers, which is equal to 10 flowers (since 25 ÷ 5 = 10).\n\nSo, the answer is 10 flores.", "prediction": "10"}

The phone of Brittany can store 50 times more photos than the number of birds in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo.\n3. The phone of Jamal can store 1800 photos.\n4. Let's use the first two statements to find the number of photos the phone of Brittany can store. Let's say the phone of Brittany can store x photos. Then, the phone of Jamal can store 6x photos (since it's 6 times more).\n5. We know the phone of Jamal can store 1800 photos, so we can set up the equation: 6x = 1800.\n6. To find the number of photos the phone of Brittany can store, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6: x = 1800 ÷ 6 = 300.\n7. Finally, the question asks how many ducks can be seen in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo. Since the phone of Brittany can store 300 photos, and the phone of Jamal can store 6 times more, the number of ducks in the photo is 300 ÷ 6 = 50.\n\nTherefore, there are 300 ducks in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo.", "prediction": "300"}
{"question": "Sasha se da cuenta de que los precios de la madera subieron un 50 % en los últimos meses después de comprar algunos trozos de madera. Como tiene sobras, decide venderlas.

También tiene cinco tablas de 4 x 4 x 10 que compró a $16 cada una. ¿Cuánto gana si vende todas?", "answer": 90, "model_output": " $20\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Sasha has 10 tables of 2x4x10 that cost $10 each, so the total cost of these tables is 10 x $10 = $100.\n2. He also has 5 tables of 4x4x10 that cost $16 each, so the total cost of these tables is 5 x $16 = $80.\n3. In total, Sasha has spent $100 + $80 = $180 on the tables.\n4. He now wants to sell the tables, but he doesn't know the current market price. However, he knows that the prices of wood have increased by 50% over the last few months. This means that the current market price of the tables is likely to be higher than the cost price.\n5. Let's assume the current market price of the tables is 50% higher than the cost price, which would be $180 x 1.5 = $270.\n6. Since Sasha has 10 tables of 2x4x10 and 5 tables of 4x4x10, he has a total of 10 + 5 = 15 tables to sell.\n7. He can sell each table for $270, so the total amount he can get from selling all the tables is 15 x $270 = $4,050.\n8. However, Sasha only spent $180 on the tables, so he is making a profit of $4,050 - $180 = $3,870.\n9. The question asks how much Sasha will gain if he sells all the tables, which is the same as the profit. Therefore, the answer is $3,870, or $20 (since $3,870 is not an option, we can take the closest option).", "prediction": "3870"}

The question asks for the total number of teaspoons of sugar used, which is 120 teaspoons.\n4. Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up a simple equation to find the number of teaspoons of sugar: 7x = 120, where x is the number of teaspoons of sugar.\n5. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7: x = 120 ÷ 7 = 17.43.\n6.

The question states that a sandía (watermelon) costs three times as much as a pimiento (pepper). Let's say the cost of a pimiento is x. Then, the cost of a sandía is 3x.\n2. The question also states that a naranja (orange) costs 5 less than a sandía. So, the cost of a naranja is 3x - 5.\n3. The problem asks for the total cost of 4 sandías, 20 pimientos, and 10 naranjas.

Hoy, hizo otra prueba de 100 preguntas al mismo ritmo. Si Mark tuvo 8 horas para hacer la primera prueba y 6 horas para hacer la segunda, ¿cuántas preguntas dejó incompletas?\"\n\n2. Break down the information provided:\n   - Mark completed the first test with 75 questions in 8 hours, which means he completed 75/8 = 9.375 questions per hour.\n   - He completed the second test with 100 questions in 6 hours, which means he completed 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour.\n   - The rate of completion is the same for both tests, 5 questions per hour.\n\n3.

{"question": "Jordan pasa 2 horas al día jugando videojuegos. También tiene un trabajo a tiempo parcial en el que gana $10 la hora. ¿Cuánto dinero ganaría Jordan en una semana si usara el tiempo que juega videojuegos para trabajar?", "answer": 140, "model_output": " Jordan would earn $560 in a week if he used the time he plays video games to work.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day.\n2. He works part-time and earns $10 per hour.\n3. To find out how much he earns in a week, we need to calculate the total hours he works in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.\n4. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, and there are 7 days in a week, he plays video games for a total of 2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.\n5. If he uses this time to work, he would earn $10/hour × 14 hours/week = $140/week.\n6. However, since he only works part-time, he might not work for the entire week. Let's assume he works for 5 days out of the 7 days in a week. In this case, he would earn $10/hour × 5 hours/day × 5 days/week = $250/week.\n7. Since Jordan plays video games for 14 hours/week, and he earns $250/week, we can set up the equation: $250/week = $10/hour × 14 hours/week.\n8. To solve for the number of hours he would need to work to earn $250/week, we can divide both sides by $10/hour: 14 hours/week ÷ $10/hour = 14 hours/week ÷ 10 = 14/10 = 1.4 hours/day.\n9. Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, he would need to work for 2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week, which is already the case.\n10. Therefore, Jordan would earn $250/week if he used the time he plays video games to work, but since he already plays video games for 14 hours/week, he would actually earn $250/week - $140/week = $110/week, which is not the case.\n11. However, if we assume he works for 5 days out of the 7 days in a week, he would earn $250/week, which is close, but not exactly $560/week.\n12. The correct answer is $560/week, which is not explicitly stated in the question. To find this, we can assume Jordan works for 7 days/week, and earns $10/hour × 7 hours/day × 7 days/week = $560/week.\n\nTherefore, Jordan would earn $560 in a week if he used the time he plays video games to work.", "prediction": "560"}

Since Carl bought 60 cookies, he has 40 cookies left over, which means he receives $0.10 in change.\n\nSo, Carl receives $0.10 in change if he pays with a $10 bill.", "prediction": "10"}
{"question": "Dave compró un paquete grande de patatas fritas y comió catorce antes de que una gaviota hambrienta le robara el paquete de las manos. Cuando la gaviota aterrizó, engulló la mitad de la cantidad de patatas fritas que había comido Dave. Luego, tres palomas lo intimidaron para que se alejara de la comida, y cada paloma comió tres patatas. Más tarde, un mapache robó dos tercios de las patatas que quedaban. Las hormigas se llevaron una última patata, dejando cinco. ¿Cuántas patatas fritas había en el paquete que compró Dave?", "answer": 48, "model_output": " Let's break down the story step by step to find the answer.\n\n1. Dave bought a big bag of french fries and ate 14 of them before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hands.\n2. When the seagull landed, it ate half of the french fries Dave had eaten, which means the seagull ate 7 french fries (half of 14).\n3. Then, three pigeons intimidated Dave to move away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 french fries. So, the pigeons ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 french fries.\n4. Later, a marmot stole two-thirds of the remaining french fries. To find out how many french fries the marmot stole, we can divide the number of french fries left by 3 (since it's two-thirds): 5 ÷ 3 = 1.67. Since you can't have a fraction of a french fry, we'll round down to 1 french fry stolen by the marmot.\n5. Finally, ants took the last french fry, leaving 5 french fries.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of french fries eaten by each creature:\n\n* Seagull: 7 french fries\n* Pigeons: 9 french fries\n* Marmot: 1 french fry\n* Ants: 1 french fry\n\nAdd up the total number of french fries eaten: 7 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18 french fries\n\nSince Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the bag, we need to subtract the number of french fries Dave ate from the total number of french fries eaten: 18 - 14 = 4 french fries.\n\nSo, there were 4 french fries in the bag that Dave bought.", "prediction": "4"}

He also sees 90 insectos with 6 patas each, so he sees a total of 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insectos.\n3. Additionally, he sees 3 invertebrados mutantes raros with 10 patas each, so he sees a total of 3 x 10 = 30 legs from the invertebrados mutantes raros.\n4. To find the total number of legs, he adds up the legs from all three groups: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1730 legs.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total number of legs, not the total number of legs from all legs. Since the question is asking for the total number of legs, we can simplify the answer to 173 legs.", "prediction": "173"}

The minimum payments for each are:\n\t* Student loans: $300/month\n\t* Credit card: $200/month\n\t* Mortgage: $500/month\n2. To find the total minimum payment, add up these amounts: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month\n3. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of the minimum, multiply the minimum by 0.5: $1000 x 0.5 = $500/month\n4. Add the minimum payment to the 50% extra to get the total payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500/month\n5.

The slow team has four runners as well, but their times are not as consistent. The first runner will take 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

The question states that 1 pato (which means \"duck\" in English) needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive.\n2. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to convert the weekly amount to daily amount. To do this, we divide the weekly amount by 7: 3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day.\n3. However, the question asks for the amount of insects needed per day, not the total amount of pounds. Since the question doesn't specify the type of insects, we assume it's referring to the total amount of insects, not the weight of the insects. So, we need to convert the daily amount of pounds to a daily amount of insects. To do this, we divide the daily amount of pounds by the specific gravity of insects, which is approximately 0.1 pounds/insect (this value may vary depending on the type of insects). Let's assume a conservative value of 0.1 pounds/insect. Then, we divide the daily amount of pounds by 0.1: 0.5 pounds/day ÷ 0.1 pounds/insect = 5 insects/day.\n4. Finally, since there are 10 patos, we need to multiply the daily amount of insects needed per pato by 10: 5 insects/day × 10 patos = 50 insects/day.\n5. The question asks for the amount of insects needed per day, so we divide the total amount of insects needed per day by 10: 50 insects/day ÷ 10 = 0.35 pounds of insects per day.\n\nTherefore, 0.35 pounds of insects are needed per day for 10 patos to survive.", "prediction": "10"}

Now, the total number of flamencos of plastic rose is 18 + 18 = 36.\n\nTo find the number of flamencos of plastic rose more than flamencos of plastic white, we need to subtract the number of flamencos of plastic white from the total number of flamencos of plastic rose. There are 36 flamencos of plastic rose and 6 flamencos of plastic white (which were painted from the original 18 flamencos of plastic rose). So, the number of flamencos of plastic rose more than flamencos of plastic white is 36 - 6 = 30.\n\nTherefore, there were 30 more flamencos of plastic rose than flamencos of plastic white on Sunday at noon.", "prediction": "30"}

Harriet has 21 years of age.\n2. Harriet has half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. Let's calculate Zack's age: 21 x 2 = 42 years. So, Zack is 42 years old.\n3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Let's calculate Adrian's age: 21 x 3 = 63 years. So, Adrian is 63 years old.\n4. To find the average age of the three, we need to add up their ages and then divide by 3. Let's add up their ages: 21 + 42 + 63 = 126 years.\n5. Divide the total age by 3: 126 ÷ 3 = 42 years.\n6.

To find the total number of pieces they can add per minute, we add Kalinda's and her mom's pieces: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.\n4. Since they need to add 360 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute: 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes.\n5. Since they can add 4 pieces per minute, we can divide the total number of minutes by 4 to find the number of hours: 60 minutes ÷ 4 = 15 hours.\n6.

To find the number of students who leave through A, we can calculate 30% of 1000: 30% = 0.3, so 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students leave through A.\n4. Now, we have 1000 - 300 = 700 students left.\n5. Of these 700 students, 3/5 leave through exit B. To find the number of students who leave through B, we can calculate 3/5 of 700: (3/5) x 700 = 420 students leave through B.\n6.

Mike had 5 friends with whom he was a pen pal, sending 2 letters per week, 5 pages long.\n2. He stopped being a pen pal with 2 of them, leaving him with 3 friends.\n3. Each of the remaining 3 friends still sends him 2 letters per week, 5 pages long.\n4. Since Mike responds in kind, he will also send 2 letters per week, 5 pages long, to each of his 3 friends.\n5. To find the total number of pages he will write per week, we multiply the number of letters per week (2) by the number of pages per letter (5): 2 x 5 = 10 pages per week.\n6. Since Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes, we can find the total number of hours he will spend writing per week by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per hour: 10 pages / 1 page per hour = 10 hours.\n7. Since Mike will write 2 letters per week, and each letter has 5 pages, he will write a total of 2 x 5 = 10 pages per week. This is the same result as step 5.\n8. Therefore, Mike will spend 60 hours per week writing letters to his friends.", "prediction": "60"}

One bag of potato chips contains 5 servings of potato chips.\n2. Each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories.\n3. The daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.\n4. So far, 1800 calories have been consumed.\n5. To find out how many more calories can be consumed, subtract the already consumed calories from the daily goal: 2000 - 1800 = 1200 calories.\n6. Since each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by 250: 1200 ÷ 250 = 4.8 servings.\n7. Since one bag of potato chips contains 5 servings, multiply the number of servings by the weight of one bag: 4.8 * 300g = 1440g.\n8.

Tim lives 2 miles from school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. If Steve finishes the race in x minutes, then Tim will finish in x + (2 / 264) minutes. We want to find x such that x + (2 / 264) > x + 3. This means (2 / 264) > 3, so (2 / 264) > (3 / 440). This is true, so Steve will be home before Tim. The time Steve will be home is x + 3 minutes, but we don't know x. However, we can find x by using the fact that Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. Let's say Steve starts at 0 minutes. Then he will be 440 feet away from school at 1 minute, 880 feet away at 2 minutes, and so on. We can set up an equation: 440 + 440 + 440 + ... + 440 = 3 miles. This is a geometric series, and the sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. In this case, a = 440 and r = 1. So S = 440 / (1 - 1) = 440 / 0 = infinity. This is not possible, since Steve can't ride his bike forever. Therefore, the problem is not well-defined, and we can't find a specific answer. However, we can conclude that Steve will be home before Tim, and the time he will be home is at least 3 minutes.", "prediction": "3"}

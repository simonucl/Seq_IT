The number of red ties is equal to the number of blue ties. Let's call the number of ties x.\n2. The price of a red tie is 1.5 times the price of a blue tie. Let's call the price of a blue tie y.\n3. The total cost of the ties is the number of ties multiplied by the price of each tie. The total cost of the blue ties is x * y, and the total cost of the red ties is x * (y + 0.5y).\n4. The total cost of the ties is the sum of the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties. We know that the total cost is 200, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx * y + (x * (y + 0.5y)) = 200\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x * y = 200\n\nSince the number of ties is equal to the number of blue ties, we can set up an equation:\n\nx = y\n\nSubstituting this equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n2(y * y) + (y + 0.5y) = 200\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3y^2 + 1.5y - 200 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n(3y - 10)(y + 20) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for y: y = 10/3 and y = -20.\n\nSince y = 10/3 is positive, we take this value. Then, we can find x by substituting y into the equation:\n\nx * (10/3) + (x * (10/3 + 5/3)) = 200\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(10/3 + 5/3)x = 200\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n10x + 5x = 600\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n15x = 600\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\nx = 40\n\nSo, the number of ties is 40. The total cost of the ties is 40 * (40/3 + 20/3) = 200.\n\nThe Answer is: 200", "prediction": "200"}

Since Sally IV and Sally XXXII are the same age, we can set up an equation:\n\nSally IV's age = Sally XXXII's age\n\n7. We know Sally XXXII is 8 years old, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nSally IV's age = 8\n\n8.

Then we have the following equation: x + y = total number of chickens. We know that the total number of chickens is 42, so we can set up the equation: x + y = 42. We also know that white chickens are 2 more than red chickens, so we can write x = y - 2. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: y - 2 + y = 42, which simplifies to 2y = 42. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 21. Then we can find x by substituting y back into the equation: x + (y - 2) = 42. Simplifying, we get x + y - 2 = 42, which is true. Therefore, there are 21 white chickens and 19 red chickens.\nThe Answer is: 19", "prediction": "19"}

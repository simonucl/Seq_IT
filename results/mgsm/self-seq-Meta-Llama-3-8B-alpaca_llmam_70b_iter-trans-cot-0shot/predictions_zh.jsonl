{"question": "制作一件袍子需要 2 匹蓝色纤维布料和这个数量一半的白色纤维布料。它一共需要用掉多少匹布料？", "answer": 3, "model_output": " \n\nTo answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The question is asking for the total number of fabric pieces needed to make a garment.\n2. It specifies that 2 pieces of blue fiber fabric and half as many pieces of white fiber fabric are needed.\n3. We can start by calculating the number of white fabric pieces needed. Since 2 blue fabric pieces are needed, and we need half as many white fabric pieces, we can divide 2 by 2 to get 1. \n4. So, we need 1 piece of white fabric.\n5. Since we already know we need 2 pieces of blue fabric, the total number of fabric pieces needed is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.", "prediction": "3"}
{"question": "乔希决定试试房屋翻新。他花了 80,000 美元买了一套房子，然后投入 50,000 美元进行维修。这样做使房子的价值增加了 150%。他赚了多少利润？", "answer": 70000, "model_output": " \n\nLet's break down the question step by step:\n\n1. The question is asking about the profit Josh made.\n2. We know that Josh spent 80,000 USD on the house and then invested 50,000 USD in renovations.\n3. The renovations increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the house is now worth 80,000 + 50,000 + x, where x is the increase in value.\n4. We can set up an equation: 80,000 + 50,000 + x = 1.5(80,000 + 50,000) (since the value of the house is 150% of the initial cost)\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 80,000 + 50,000 - 1.5(80,000 + 50,000) = 80,000 + 50,000 - 120,000 = 10,000\n6. The profit is the difference between the final value of the house and the initial cost: 10,000 - 80,000 = -70,000 (but this is negative, which doesn't make sense)\n7. Let's check our calculations: 1.5(80,000 + 50,000) = 120,000, which is correct. But the profit is still negative.\n8. The correct answer is that Josh didn't make any profit. The renovations increased the value of the house, but the cost of the renovations was more than the increase in value.", "prediction": "8"}

We are also given that the number of downloads in the second month is 3 times the number of downloads in the first month, which means it's 3 x 60 = 180 times.\n4.

Mary works at the same company for 40 years, which means she has 40 years of service.\n2. She can receive an annual pension of $50,000.\n3. Starting 20 years from now, she has the right to receive 5% of the annual pension's value. This means she will receive 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500.\n4.

Sophia is planning a road trip and wants to know how far she can go with one gallon of gas. She has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she needs to refill her tank with 4 gallons of gas to reach her destination.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how far Sophia can go with one gallon of gas. We know that her car's tank can hold 12 gallons of gas, and she needs 4 gallons to refill her tank. So, if she has 12 gallons and needs 4, that means she has 8 gallons left. With 8 gallons, Sophia can go a certain distance. Let's say the distance she can go with 1 gallon is x miles. Then, with 8 gallons, she can go 8x miles.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find x. We know that Sophia has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she needs 4 gallons to refill her tank. So, we can write the equation:\n\n8x + 100 = 4\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n8x = 4 - 100\n8x = -96\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\nx = -96 ÷ 8\nx = -12\n\nSo, Sophia can go -12 miles with one gallon of gas. Wait, that's negative! That doesn't make sense. Let's go back and check our calculations.\n\nAh, I think I found the mistake. We need to subtract 100 from 4, not add it. The correct equation is:\n\n8x + 100 = 4\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n8x = 4 - 100\n8x = -96\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\nx = -96 ÷ 8\nx = -12\n\nSo, Sophia can go -12 miles with one gallon of gas. Wait, that's still negative! Let's try again.\n\nNo, I think I found the real mistake. We need to convert the distance from miles to gallons. The question asks how far Sophia can go with one gallon of gas, but we've been calculating the distance in miles. Let's convert 100 miles to gallons. According to the question, Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon. So, 100 miles is equal to 4 gallons. Now, we can set up a new equation:\n\n4x + 4 = 8\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n4x = 8 - 4\n4x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 4 ÷ 4\nx = 1\n\nSo, Sophia can go 1 gallon with one gallon of gas. Wait, that's not a distance! Let's try again.\n\nNo, I think I found the final mistake. We need to calculate the distance Sophia can go with one gallon of gas based on her car's fuel efficiency. We know that Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon. So, with one gallon, she can go 25 miles.\n\nAnswer: Sophia can go 25 miles with one gallon of gas.", "prediction": "25"}

If Cindy has four pets, then they three girls have a total of how many pets?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Jen's pet count is three times that of Maria's, so Jen's pet count is 3 x Maria's pet count.\n2. Maria's pet count is two more than Cindy's, so Maria's pet count is 2 + Cindy's pet count.\n3. If Cindy has four pets, then Cindy's pet count is 4.\n4. We can plug in the values we know: Jen's pet count = 3 x Maria's pet count, and Maria's pet count = 2 + Cindy's pet count.\n5. We can solve for Maria's pet count: Maria's pet count = 2 + Cindy's pet count = 2 + 4 = 6.\n6. Now, we can find Jen's pet count: Jen's pet count = 3 x Maria's pet count = 3 x 6 = 18.\n7.

We need to find the total number of pets, which is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.\n\nSecond, we are given that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the sum of the number of dogs and cats. Let's call the number of dogs and cats x. Then, the number of rabbits is x - 12.\n\nThird, we are given that the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1, so for every 2 cats, there is 1 dog. Let's say the number of cats is 2x. Then, the number of dogs is x.\n\nFourth, we are given that the total number of dogs is 60. So, x = 60.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pets. The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

This means she slept 6 + 6 = 12 hours in total on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n* If she sleeps 1 more hour in the remaining time of the week, this means she will sleep 12 + 1 = 13 hours in total on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n* To find the total number of hours Sati slept on Monday, we need to add up the hours she slept on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n* So, the answer is: 8 (hours on Monday) + 12 (hours on Tuesday and Wednesday) + 1 (additional hour in the remaining time of the week) = 21 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 21 hours.", "prediction": "21"}

The price of the watermelons is three times the price of the peppers. The price of the oranges is 5 dollars less than the price of the watermelons. Dragon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges at this store. If each pepper costs 15 dollars, how much will he need to pay in total?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* We know that the price of the watermelons is three times the price of the peppers. Let's call the price of the peppers \"x\". Then, the price of the watermelons is 3x.\n* We also know that the price of the oranges is 5 dollars less than the price of the watermelons. So, the price of the oranges is 3x - 5.\n* Dragon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let's calculate the total cost:\n\t+ 4 watermelons x 3x = 12x\n\t+ 20 peppers x x = 20x\n\t+ 10 oranges x (3x - 5) = 10(3x - 5) = 30x - 50\n* We know that each pepper costs 15 dollars, so x = 15. Now, let's calculate the total cost:\n\t+ 12x = 12(15) = 180\n\t+ 20x = 20(15) = 300\n\t+ 30x - 50 = 30(15) - 50 = 450 - 50 = 400\n* The total cost is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880.

{"question": "一家医院每天接诊 500 人。每位患者的看诊时长平均为 24 分钟。医生对医院收费每小时 150 美元，医院对患者收费每小时 200 美元。医院从这些就诊中获得多少利润？", "answer": 10000, "model_output": " Let's break down the question step by step:\n\n1. The hospital sees 500 patients per day. Let's assume this is the total number of patients seen in a day, including those who see multiple doctors.\n\n2. The average time for each patient's consultation is 24 minutes. This means that the total time spent by all patients seeing doctors is 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.\n\n3. Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Let's assume the hospital charges patients a flat rate of $200 per hour, regardless of the actual time spent with the doctor.\n\n4. The hospital's revenue from patient fees is therefore 12,000 minutes x $200/hour = $2,400,000.\n\n5. The hospital pays doctors $150 per hour, so the total amount paid to doctors is 12,000 minutes x $150/hour = $1,800,000.\n\n6. The hospital's profit is the difference between its revenue and expenses: $2,400,000 (revenue) - $1,800,000 (expenses) = $600,000.\n\nSo, the hospital's profit from the 500 patients seen per day is $600,000.", "prediction": "600000"}

{"question": "蜂巢中有 700 只蜜蜂。工蜂的数量是幼蜂的两倍，幼蜂的数量是蜂后的两倍。工蜂有多少只？", "answer": 400, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nFirst, we're given that there are 700 bees in the hive. Let's call this total number of bees \"T\".\n\nWe're told that the number of worker bees is twice the number of drones (worker bees are the ones that do the work, and drones are the ones that mate with the queen). So, the number of worker bees is 2T.\n\nThen, we're told that the number of drones is twice the number of queen bees. Since we know that there are 700 bees total, and the number of drones is 2T, we can set up an equation:\n\n2T = 700 - q\n\nwhere q is the number of queen bees.\n\nWe're also told that the number of drones is twice the number of queen bees, so we can set up another equation:\n\nT = 2q\n\nNow, we can substitute 2T = 700 - q into T = 2q to get:\n\n2q = 700 - q\n\nSimplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n3q = 700\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nq = 233.33\n\nSo, there are approximately 233.33 queen bees in the hive.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of worker bees.

Locksin caught fewer starfish and seahorses than Annakin, but more clownfish.\n4. The question wants to know the total number of fish caught by both of them.\n\nTo answer this, we need to add up the number of fish caught by both Annakin and Locksin.\n\nAnnakin caught: 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish\nLocksin caught: (less than Annakin, but we don't know the exact number, but we know it's less than 19)\n\nSince Locksin caught fewer starfish and seahorses, we can subtract 5 starfish and 2 seahorses from Annakin's catch to get:\n\nLocksin caught: 19 - 5 - 2 = 12 fish (but this is not the correct answer, as Locksin caught more clownfish than Annakin)\n\nTo get the correct answer, we need to add up the number of clownfish caught by both Annakin and Locksin:\n\nAnnakin caught: 3 clownfish\nLocksin caught: (more than Annakin, but we don't know the exact number, but we know it's more than 3)\n\nLet's assume Locksin caught x clownfish (where x is a positive integer). Then, the total number of clownfish caught by both Annakin and Locksin is:\n\n3 + x\n\nTo find the total number of fish caught by both Annakin and Locksin, we add up the total number of fish caught by both:\n\n19 (Annakin's total fish) + 3 + x (Locksin's total fish) = 22 + x\n\nThe question doesn't provide the exact value of x, but it's clear that Locksin caught more clownfish than Annakin. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n22 + x, where x is a positive integer greater than 3.\n\nSo, the answer is not a specific number, but a range of numbers (22 + x, where x is a positive integer greater than 3).", "prediction": "3"}

We can set up an equation using this information: 3x + 4 = 5.\n* To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 5 - 4.\n* Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = (5 - 4) / 3.\n* x = 1.\n\nNow that we have the price of a toy person, we can find the total value of all the toys:\n\n* The doll costs x * 3 = 3x dollars.\n* The 5 toy cars cost 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.\n* The 3 toy people cost 3 * x = 3 * 1 = 3 dollars.\n* The total value of all the toys is the sum of these amounts: 3x + 20 + 3 = 26.\n\nSo, the answer is 26.", "prediction": "26"}

This means that Pool A now has 4x gallons of water.\n\nWe want to find the amount of water in Pool B now. Since Pool B has a leak, it's losing water at the same rate as Pool A. Let's say the amount of water in Pool B now is y.

We also know that Carlos used the boat for 3 hours and Benji used the paddle for 5 hours.\n\nTo find the total amount of money they need to pay, we need to calculate the total cost for each person and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Carlos' total cost:\n$30 per hour x 3 hours = $90\n\nNext, let's calculate Benji's total cost:\n$18 per hour x 5 hours = $90\n\nNow, let's add up the total costs:\n$90 + $90 = $180\n\nTherefore, Carlos and Benji need to pay a total of $180 for their boat rentals.", "prediction": "180"}

The farm produced 120 small watermelons initially.\n2. Ashlyn went to the farm two months later and found 30% of the watermelons were ripe (i.e., 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons).\n3. She took these 36 ripe watermelons back home.\n4. Two weeks later, Ashlyn returned to the farm and found that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe (i.e., 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons = 63 watermelons).\n5. She picked all 63 ripe watermelons.\n\nTo find out how many watermelons were still unripe, we need to subtract the number of watermelons Ashlyn picked (36 + 63 = 99) from the initial number of watermelons (120). Therefore, there were 21 watermelons that were still unripe.\n\nSo, the answer is 21.", "prediction": "21"}

Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Mark bought a fleet of 12 cars, each costing $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is $20,000 x 12 = $240,000.\n2. He paid 10% tax on these cars, which is $240,000 x 0.10 = $24,000.\n3. He also paid a $1,000 registration fee for each car, which is $1,000 x 12 = $12,000.\n4. To find the total amount Mark spent, we add up the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000.\n5. However, Mark paid for the cars with a 10% discount, so we deduct 10% from the total cost: $276,000 x 0.90 = $220,000.\n\nTherefore, Mark spent a total of $220,000 for the car fleet.", "prediction": "220000"}

If Jessica is 20 years old, what is the total age of the three girls?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is Joan's age - 2.\n2. Joan is five years older than Jessica, so Joan's age is Jessica's age + 5.\n3. We know that Jessica is 20 years old, so we can write an equation: Jessica's age + 5 = 20.\n\nNow, we need to find the total age of the three girls. Let's call the total age \"T\". We can write an equation:\n\nT = Mary's age + Joan's age + Jessica's age\nT = (Joan's age - 2) + (Joan's age + 5) + 20\nT = 2Joan's age - 2 + 20\nT = 2Joan's age + 18\n\nWe know that Joan's age is Jessica's age + 5, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nT = 2(Jessica's age + 5) + 18\nT = 2Jessica's age + 10 + 18\nT = 2Jessica's age + 28\n\nWe know that Jessica's age is 20, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nT = 2(20) + 28\nT = 40 + 28\nT = 68\n\nTherefore, the total age of the three girls is 68.", "prediction": "68"}

The movie takes 5 weeks to film, so Jean will need 6 hours of makeup per day for 4 days a week for 5 weeks.\n4. The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount after the movie is finished, which means Jean gets 10% off the total cost.\n5. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of hours of makeup Jean needs, and then multiply it by the hourly rate.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of hours of makeup Jean needs:\n\n* 6 hours per day for 4 days a week for 5 weeks = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n* 120 hours x $250 per hour = $30,000\n\nSince Jean gets a 10% discount, she gets $3,000 off the total cost:\n\n* $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000\n\nSo, Jean paid a total of $27,000 for the makeup services.", "prediction": "27000"}

{"question": "Avant d'aller travailler au café, Candice a mis 80 pense-bêtes dans son sac à main. En chemin, elle s'est arrêtée pour acheter un paquet de pense-bêtes au magasin. Arrivée au travail, elle a placé un pense-bête sur chacune des 220 tasses de café.

When she arrived at work, she placed a pensée on each of the 220 coffee cups.\n4. Later, she had 23 pensées left.\n\nTo find the number of pensées in the package she bought, we need to calculate the total number of pensées Candice had at the beginning, the total number of pensées she used, and subtract the remaining pensées from the total.\n\nLet's start with the total number of pensées Candice had at the beginning: 80\n\nShe used 80 pensées for the coffee cups: 1 pensée per cup x 220 cups = 220 pensées\n\nNow, subtract the remaining pensées from the total: 80 (initial pensées) - 220 (used pensées) + 23 (remaining pensées) = ?\n\nTo solve for the number of pensées in the package, we need to find the difference between the initial number of pensées and the number of pensées used, minus the remaining pensées. This gives us:\n\n80 - 220 + 23 = ?\n\nTo calculate this, we can start with 80 and subtract 220, then add 23:\n\n80 - 220 = -140\n-140 + 23 = -117\n\nSo, there were 117 pensées in the package Candice bought.", "prediction": "117"}

His chickens lay 252 eggs per day and he sells them at $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd earn per week with his eggs?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Lloyd earns money by selling eggs.\n* He sells 252 eggs per day.\n* He sells them at $2 per dozen, which means he gets $2 for every 12 eggs he sells.\n* To find out how much Lloyd earns per week, we need to multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by the number of days in a week.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nLloyd earns $2 per dozen eggs, and he sells 252 eggs per day. To find out how much he earns per week, we multiply the number of eggs he sells per day by the number of days in a week:\n\n252 eggs/day × 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week\n\nSince Lloyd earns $2 per dozen eggs, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens:\n\n1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 144 dozen/week\n\nNow, multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd earns per week:\n\n144 dozen/week × $2/dozen = $288/week\n\nTherefore, Lloyd earns $288 per week with his eggs.", "prediction": "288"}

If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys will he need to remove?\n\nLet's think step-by-step:\n\n* Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from the bag.\n* Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so if he removes 30 comic books, he will remove 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n* This means he needs to remove 7.5 pounds more to reach the target weight of 15 pounds.\n* Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so if he removes x toys, he will remove x x 1/2 = 7.5 pounds.\n* We can set up an equation: x x 1/2 = 7.5 - 7.5 = 0. Therefore, x = 0.\n\nThis means Uriah doesn't need to remove any toys to reach the target weight of 15 pounds. He can simply remove the 30 comic books to achieve the desired weight reduction.", "prediction": "30"}

After that, she needs to feed it 2 bowls per day for the rest of its life. If a bag of dog food contains 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food will Cécilia use in the first year?\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* In the first 180 days, Cécilia needs to use 1 bag of dog food per day, so she'll need 180 bags.\n* After 180 days, she needs to use 2 bags per day, so she'll need an additional 2 bags per day for the remaining 365 days (since there are 365 days in a leap year, and we'll assume the puppy lives for a full year).\n* Since 1 bag contains 110 bowls, Cécilia will need 110 bags in total.\n\nSo, Cécilia will use 180 bags of dog food in the first 180 days, and then an additional 2 bags per day for the remaining 365 days, totaling 110 bags. Therefore, she will use 290 bags of dog food in the first year.", "prediction": "290"}

So, we can set up an equation to find the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David.\n\nLet R be the amount of laundry done by Raymond, and let D be the amount of laundry done by David.\n\nWe know that Sara does 400 liters, so we can write an equation:\n\nSara's laundry = 400 liters\n\nWe also know that Raymond does 1/2 as much laundry as Sara, so:\n\nRaymond's laundry = 1/2 x Sara's laundry\n= 1/2 x 400 liters\n= 200 liters\n\nNow, we know that David does 1/4 as much laundry as Sara, so:\n\nDavid's laundry = 1/4 x Sara's laundry\n= 1/4 x 400 liters\n= 100 liters\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David:\n\nDifference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry\n= 200 liters - 100 liters\n= 100 liters\n\nSo, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 100 liters.", "prediction": "100"}

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace. What is the total weight of both of them in pounds?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Grace weighs 125 pounds.\n* Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace. This means Alex weighs 4 times the weight of Grace minus 2 pounds.\n\nLet's say the weight of Grace is x. Then, the weight of Alex is 4x - 2.\n\nThe question asks us to find the total weight of both Grace and Alex. This is the sum of their individual weights.\n\nSo, we need to find the sum of 125 (Grace's weight) and (4x - 2) (Alex's weight).\n\nThe sum is: 125 + (4x - 2)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get: 127 + 4x - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. We can do this by using the information that Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times the weight of Grace. This means 4x - 2 = 125.\n\nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get 4x = 127.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 127/4.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the total weight of both Grace and Alex.\n\nSubstituting x = 127/4 into the expression 127 + 4x - 2, we get:\n\n127 + 4(127/4) - 2\n127 + 127/4 + 127/4 - 2\n127 + 127/2 - 2\n127 + 63.5 - 2\n127 + 61.5\n\nSo, the total weight of both Grace and Alex is 127 + 61.5 = 188.5 pounds.", "prediction": "188.5"}

This means that they won a certain number of matches, and that number is more than the number of matches they lost.\n* The question is asking us to find out how many times they won.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find the number of matches they won. Since they won _ times more than they lost, we can set up an equation:\n\nWins = 22 (matches played) + (number of times they won more than they lost)\n\nWe don't know the exact number of wins, but we can figure it out by using the information given. Let's say the number of wins is x.

Let's plug it in:\n\n20 + 5 + 10x + 60 = 105\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n10x + 60 = 105 - 20 - 5\n10x = 80\nx = 8\n\nSo, the fourth friend rang the bell 8 times.\n\nNow, let's go back to the original equation:\n\n20 + 5 + 10x + 60 = 105\n20 + 5 + 10(8) + 60 = 105\n20 + 5 + 80 + 60 = 105\n185 = 105\n\nThis is a mistake!

Translate the question to English: \"Poppy tries to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, and then her mother places a third of the remaining pieces. How many puzzle pieces are left to place?\"\n\n2. Break down the problem: We are given that Poppy places a quarter of the pieces (1/4) and her mother places a third of the remaining pieces (1/3). We need to find the total number of pieces left to place.\n\n3. Calculate the number of pieces left: Let's say there are x pieces in total. Poppy places 1/4 of the pieces, so she places x/4 pieces. Her mother places 1/3 of the remaining pieces, which means she places (x - x/4)/3 pieces. We can set up an equation:\n\n(x - x/4) / 3 = 1/4\n\nSolve for x: x - x/4 = 3/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4x - x = 3\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n3x = 3 + x\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate x:\n\n2x = 3\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pieces left to place. Since Poppy placed x/4 pieces, she left (x - x/4) pieces. Her mother placed (x - x/4)/3 pieces, which is equal to 1/4 of the remaining pieces. So, her mother placed (x - x/4)/4 pieces. The total number of pieces left to place is therefore:\n\n(x - x/4) + (x - x/4)/4 = x - x/4 + x/4 - 1/4 = x - 1/4\n\nWe know that x = 3/2, so:\n\nx - 1/4 = 3/2 - 1/4 = 5/4\n\nThere are 5/4 pieces left to place. Since we can't place a fraction of a piece, we need to convert 5/4 to a whole number. The nearest whole number is 5, so there are 5 pieces left to place.\n\nAnswer: 800.", "prediction": "800"}

The question is asking us to find the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week.\n\nNext, we need to read the given information carefully. We are told that Pancho walks 20 miles every day, except for the weekend, where he walks 10 miles.\n\nNow, let's think about it. If Pancho walks 20 miles every day, except for the weekend, that means he walks 20 miles on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. But on Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day.\n\nTo find the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on each day. We can do this by multiplying the number of days in a week (5) by the number of miles he walks on each day (20), and then adding the miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday (10 + 10).\n\nSo, the answer is: Pancho walks a total of 5 x 20 = 100 miles on Monday to Friday, and 10 + 10 = 20 miles on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week.\n\nAnswer: 120 miles", "prediction": "120"}

She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum for her debts. This means she wants to pay a certain amount that is 50% higher than the total minimum payment.\n\nLet's calculate the total minimum payment first:\n\nMinimum payment for student loan: $300\nMinimum payment for credit card: $200\nMinimum payment for mortgage: $500\n\nTotal minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Jessica needs to pay in a year. To do this, we'll multiply the total minimum payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):\n\nTotal minimum payment per year: $1000 x 12 = $12,000\n\nSince Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we'll add 50% to the total minimum payment:\n\nTotal payment per year: $12,000 + ($12,000 x 0.5) = $18,000\n\nSo, Jessica should pay $18,000 in a year to cover all her debts.", "prediction": "18000"}

One weekend, her neighbors decide to play a prank on her. On Friday morning, they place 18 plastic flamingos in her garden. On Saturday morning, they take away one third of the flamingos, paint them white, and put them back in Sue's garden. Then, on Sunday morning, they add 18 more plastic flamingos to the collection.\n\nNow, let's focus on the question: \"At 12:00 on Sunday, how many more plastic flamingos were there in the garden than the number of white flamingos?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to calculate the total number of flamingos in the garden at 12:00 on Sunday. Let's start with the number of flamingos on Friday morning: 18. On Saturday morning, they take away one third of them, which means 6 flamingos are removed. So, the number of flamingos left in the garden at the end of Saturday is 18 - 6 = 12.\n\nOn Sunday morning, they add 18 more flamingos, so the total number of flamingos in the garden at 12:00 on Sunday is 12 + 18 = 30.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of these flamingos are white. We know that on Saturday morning, they painted one third of the flamingos white, which means they painted 6 flamingos white. Since we don't know the color of the remaining flamingos, we can't say exactly how many are white. However, we can say that the number of white flamingos is at least 6, because that's the minimum number of flamingos that were painted white.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find the difference between the total number of flamingos in the garden at 12:00 on Sunday (30) and the number of white flamingos (at least 6).

Let's say the rate for Editor A is x cents per phrase, and the rate for Editor B is 2x cents per phrase (since it's twice as much).\n\nWe know that Marc earns 5 cents per phrase from Editor A, so x = 5. Then, we can calculate how much he earns from Editor B:\n\nMarc earns 2x cents per phrase from Editor B, which is 2(5) = 10 cents per phrase.

Initially, it had some amount of water. Then, it lost 4 gallons of water in 4 minutes, which means it lost 1 gallon of water per minute. Since the big pool had twice as much water initially, it must have had 2 gallons of water per minute. Now, the big pool has four times as much water, so it must have 4 gallons of water per minute.\n\nLet's say the small pool had x gallons of water initially. Then, it lost 1 gallon of water per minute, so it has x - 4x/4 = x/4 gallons of water now. The big pool has 4x/4 = x gallons of water now. Since the big pool has four times as much water, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/4 = 4x\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:\n\nx = 16x\n\nSubtracting 16x from both sides gives us:\n\n-15x = 0\n\nDividing both sides by -15 gives us:\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the small pool has 0 gallons of water now. However, this doesn't make sense because the problem states that the big pool has four times as much water, which means the small pool must have some water. Let's go back and think about the problem again!\n\nLet's say the small pool had x gallons of water initially.

Since Harriet's age is half of Zack's age, we can write:\n\nHarriet's age = 1/2 × Zack's age\n\nWe know Harriet's current age is 21, so we can write:\n\n1/2 × Zack's age = 21\n\nTo solve for Zack's age, multiply both sides by 2:\n\nZack's age = 2 × 21 = 42\n\nNow that we have Zack's age, we can find Harriet's age in terms of Zack's age:\n\nHarriet's age = 1/2 × Zack's age\n= 1/2 × 42\n= 21\n\nSo, Harriet's age is indeed 21.\n\nNow, we need to find the average age of the three (Adrian, Harriet, and Zack) in three years.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Jean wants to order pizzas that are cut into 4 pieces each, but the pizzas are only sold in 8-piece slices. To get 4 pieces from 8, we can divide 8 by 4, which gives us 2 groups of 4 pieces each.\n2. Since Jean wants to make sure each of his 20 friends gets 4 pieces, we need to calculate how many groups of 4 pieces we can make from 20 pieces.\n3. Divide 20 by 4, which gives us 5 groups of 4 pieces each.\n4. Since each group needs 1 pizza, Jean needs to order 5 pizzas to ensure that each of his 20 friends gets 4 pieces.\n\nSo, Jean needs to order 5 pizzas.", "prediction": "5"}

Si Jessa a 20 ans, quelle est la somme des âges des trois filles ?", "answer": 68, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step!\n\nFirst, we need to translate the question to English:\n\n\"Marie is two years younger than Jeanne, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa has 20 years, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step:\n\n1. Marie is two years younger than Jeanne, so Marie's age is Jeanne's age - 2.\n2. Jeanne is five years older than Jessa, so Jeanne's age is Jessa's age + 5.\n3. We know that Jessa has 20 years, so let's call Jessa's age x.\n4. We can write an equation: Jeanne's age = Jessa's age + 5, so x + 5 = ... (we'll fill in the age of Jeanne later).\n5. Marie's age = Jeanne's age - 2, so x - 2 = ... (we'll fill in the age of Marie later).\n6. We need to find the sum of the ages of the three girls: Marie's age + Jeanne's age + Jessa's age = ... (we'll fill in the ages later).\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nIf Jessa has 20 years, then x = 20.\n\nWe can find Jeanne's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: x + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25.\n\nWe can find Marie's age by subtracting 2 from Jeanne's age: x - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the ages of the three girls: Marie's age + Jeanne's age + Jessa's age = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68.\n\nSo, the answer is 68.", "prediction": "68"}

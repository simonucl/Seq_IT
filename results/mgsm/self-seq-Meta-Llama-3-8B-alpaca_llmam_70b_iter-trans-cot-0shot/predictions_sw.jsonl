{"question": "Josha anaamua kujaribu kununua nyumba na kuuza kwa faida. Ananunua nyumba kwa $80,000 na kutumia $50,000 kuikarabati. Hii iliongeza thamani ya nyumba hiyo kwa 150%. Alipata faida ya kiasi gani?", "answer": 70000, "model_output": " Let's break down the question step by step:\n\n1. The question is asking about the profit Joshua made from buying and selling a house.\n2. Joshua bought the house for $80,000 and renovated it for $50,000, which increased the house's value by 150%.\n3. To find the profit, we need to calculate the total amount Joshua spent on the house and the total amount he sold it for.\n\nLet's assume the house was worth $x before the renovation (i.e., the original price). Since the renovation increased the value by 150%, we can calculate the new price as:\n\nNew price = Original price x (1 + 150%) = $x x 1.15 = $x + $13,500 (approximately)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we know:\n\nOriginal price = $80,000\nRenovation cost = $50,000\n\nTo find the total amount Joshua spent on the house, we add the original price and renovation cost:\n\nTotal amount spent = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\nSince the new price is $x + $13,500, we can set up an equation to find the new price:\n\n$x + $13,500 = 130,000\n\nSubtract $13,500 from both sides:\n\n$x = 130,000 - $13,500 = $116,500\n\nNow, we can find the profit by subtracting the total amount spent from the new price:\n\nProfit = New price - Total amount spent\n= $116,500 - $130,000\n= -$13,500\n\nWait, didn't we just say the profit is the difference between the sale price and the total amount spent? That's correct! We made a mistake earlier. Let's correct it:\n\nProfit = New price - Total amount spent\n= $116,500 - $130,000\n= -$13,500\n\nBut, we also know that the profit is 150% of the renovation cost. Can we find the profit another way?\n\nProfit = Renovation cost x 150%\n= $50,000 x 150%\n= $75,000\n\nThis is the correct profit! The answer is $75,000.", "prediction": "75000"}

We'll calculate her pay for 45 hours and then multiply it by 1.2 to get her overtime pay.\n\n* Her pay for 45 hours is $10 x 45 = $450.\n* Her overtime pay is $450 x 1.2 = $540.\n\nNow, add her usual pay and overtime pay to get her total earnings for the week:\n\n* Total pay = $450 (usual pay) + $540 (overtime pay) = $990\n\nSo, Eliza's earnings for the week are $990.", "prediction": "990"}

The question states that the businessman's financial advisor estimates that the market of kitchen utensils will increase by 2.5% within the next month, while the market of electronic equipment will increase by 1.2%.\n4. The question asks what would be the highest profit for the businessman if he wants to make a purchase decision within the next month.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to calculate the profit margin for each option. Let's assume the businessman wants to make a profit of, say, 10% (this can be adjusted based on the businessman's target profit margin).\n\nOption 1: Purchase electronic equipment worth $8,000\n\n* Assuming the price of electronic equipment increases by 1.2% within the next month, the new price would be: $8,000 x (1 + 1.2%) = $8,080\n* Profit = $8,080 - $8,000 = $80\n* Profit margin = $80 / $8,000 = 1%\n\nOption 2: Purchase kitchen utensils worth $5,000\n\n* Assuming the price of kitchen utensils increases by 2.5% within the next month, the new price would be: $5,000 x (1 + 2.5%) = $5,075\n* Profit = $5,075 - $5,000 = $75\n* Profit margin = $75 / $5,000 = 1.5%\n\nBased on the calculations, Option 2 (purchasing kitchen utensils) has a higher profit margin (1.5% vs 1%).

If one pair of shoes that has just gone on sale costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much as the first pair, how much will Gloria pay for the best pair of shoes?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Gloria needs to choose between two pairs of shoes.\n* One pair costs $33.\n* The other pair costs twice as much as the first pair, which means it costs 2 x $33 = $66.\n* The best pair is the one that is on sale for a lower price than the original price of the best pair. This means that the best pair is either the $33 pair or the $66 pair.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nIf Gloria chooses the $33 pair, she will pay $33.\n\nIf Gloria chooses the $66 pair, she will pay $66.\n\nSince the question asks for the best pair, we need to find the lower price. The lower price is $33. Therefore, Gloria will pay $33 for the best pair of shoes.", "prediction": "33"}

The translation is:\n\n\"Darrel and Allen are currently 7:11 years apart. If their current total age is 162 years, how old will Allen be 10 years from now?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* We are given that Darrel and Allen are currently 7:11 years apart, which means Darrel is 7:11 years older than Allen.\n* We are also given that their current total age is 162 years.\n* We need to find Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nTo do this, we need to subtract 10 years from their current total age. However, we need to be careful because Darrel is 7:11 years older than Allen. We need to subtract 10 years from Darrel's age and then subtract 7:11 years from the result to get Allen's age 10 years from now.\n\nLet's do the calculations:\n\n* Darrel's age 10 years from now = 162 - 10 = 152\n* Allen's age 10 years from now = 152 - 7:11 = 144 (this is the age of Allen 10 years from now)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 144.", "prediction": "144"}

We know that 1 serving of chips is 250 calories, and we want to find out how many servings we can eat.\n3. We are given that we have 300 grams of chips and we want to eat 5 servings.\n4. To find out how many grams of chips we can eat, we need to calculate the total number of servings we can eat based on our daily calorie goal.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of servings we can eat:\n\nTotal calories in 300 grams of chips = 5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories\n\nSince we've already eaten 1800 calories, we need to subtract 1800 from 2000 to find out how many more calories we can eat:\n\n2000 (daily calorie goal) - 1800 (calories already eaten) = 100\n\nNow, we can divide the total calories in 300 grams of chips by 100 to find out how many grams of chips we can eat:\n\n1250 calories / 100 = 12.5 servings\n\nSince we have 300 grams of chips, we can eat:\n\n12.5 servings x 300 grams/serving = 3750 grams\n\nSo, we can eat 3750 grams of chips.", "prediction": "3750"}

Akiuza kila mshumaa kwa $2.00 kwa kila moja, jumla ya faida yake akitengeneza na kuuza mishumaa 20 itakuwa ngapi?", "answer": 20, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the question. Charlie wants to know how much profit he can make by selling 20 bees' honey.\n\nNext, we need to read the given information carefully. We can see that Charlie can produce 10 jars of honey from one bee's honey, and each jar costs $10.00. He sells each jar for $2.00, so his profit per jar is $2.00 - $10.00 = -$8.00 (but we want to find the profit, so we'll take the negative value as $8.00).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total profit Charlie can make by selling 20 jars of honey. He can produce 20 jars from 1 bee's honey, so he can produce 20 jars from 2 bees' honey (since 2 bees can produce the same amount of honey as 1 bee). The total cost of the honey will be 2 bees x $10.00 = $20.00. The total profit will be the total sale price minus the total cost: $20.00 - $20.00 = $0.00.\n\nHowever, we want to find the profit per bee, not the total profit. To do this, we can divide the total profit by the number of bees: $0.00 ÷ 2 = -$10.00. This means that Charlie will lose $10.00 per bee.\n\nSo, the answer is that Charlie will lose $10.00 per bee by selling 20 bees' honey.", "prediction": "20"}

That would mean he would need $14 for the tickets and snacks (2 x $7 + $7 = $14). Since he has $42, he can go more than 2 times.\n\nIf Pete wants to go 3 times, he would need $21 (3 x $7 + $7 = $21). Again, he has $42, so he can go more than 3 times.\n\nIf Pete wants to go 4 times, he would need $28 (4 x $7 + $7 = $28). With $42, he can go more than 4 times.\n\nThe pattern is clear. Pete can go to the movies as many times as he wants, as long as he has enough money.

Mercy works for 40 years at the company, so she will receive a total of $50,000 per year for 40 years.\n\n2. From year 21 onwards, she is entitled to 5% of the total amount she has received so far as a bonus. This means that she will receive an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.\n\n3. After 30 years, Mercy leaves the company. Let's calculate her total earnings so far:\n\nTotal earnings after 30 years = $50,000 per year for 30 years = $1,500,000\n\n4. Mercy is entitled to 5% of this total amount, which is $1,500,000 x 5% = $75,000.\n\n5. Therefore, Mercy's annual payment will be $75,000 after she leaves the company.\n\n6. Since the question asks for the total amount after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount Mercy will receive over the next 30 years:\n\nTotal amount after 30 years = $75,000 per year for 30 years = $2,250,000\n\nSo, Mercy will receive a total of $2,250,000 after 30 years.", "prediction": "30"}

The question is asking about a treasure chest that was buried and filled with various items.\n2. The treasure chest had a total of 175 gold coins, a few silver coins, and a large number of copper coins.\n3. The ratio of gold coins to silver coins was 35:1, meaning for every 35 silver coins, there were 1 gold coin.\n4. The number of copper coins was twice the number of silver coins.\n5. The question asks how many copper coins were in the treasure chest in total.\n\nTo answer this, we can start by finding the number of silver coins. Since the ratio is 35:1, we can divide the total number of gold coins (175) by 35 to get the number of silver coins:\n\n175 ÷ 35 = 5\n\nSo, there were 5 silver coins.\n\nSince the number of copper coins is twice the number of silver coins, we can multiply 5 by 2 to get:\n\n5 × 2 = 10\n\nTherefore, there were 10 copper coins in the treasure chest.\n\nThe question doesn't specify the value of the copper coins, but since they are being counted separately, we can assume that they have some value. Let's assume the copper coins are worth $1 each, for example. Then, the total value of the copper coins would be:\n\n10 copper coins × $1 each = $10\n\nThe question doesn't ask about the value of the copper coins, but if we assume they have a value, we can calculate the total value of the copper coins.", "prediction": "10"}

This means that Sarah's shoes are 2 sizes larger than Raymond's shoes.\n* We also know that Sarah buys 4 more pairs of shoes than David. This means that David buys x pairs of shoes, and Sarah buys x + 4 pairs of shoes.\n* We want to find the total number of pairs of shoes that Raymond and David buy in total. Let's call this total number of pairs y.\n* We know that they spend a total of £400 on shoes, which means that y * 400 = the total cost of the shoes.\n\nNow, let's try to find the value of y:\n\n* We can start by using the fact that Sarah's shoes are 2 sizes larger than Raymond's shoes. Let's say Raymond's shoes are size x. Then, Sarah's shoes are size x + 2.\n* We can use the fact that Sarah buys 4 more pairs of shoes than David. Let's say David's shoes are size x - 2 (since they are 2 sizes smaller than Sarah's). Then, Sarah buys shoes in size x - 2, x - 1, x, x + 1, and x + 2.\n* We can count the number of pairs of shoes that Raymond and David buy in total: y = 1 (Raymond's shoes) + 1 (David's shoes) + 5 (Sarah's shoes) = 7.\n* Now, we can use the fact that they spend a total of £400 on shoes: 7 * 400 = £2800. This is not equal to £400, so we need to adjust our calculation.\n\nLet's try to find the value of x. We know that Sarah's shoes are 2 sizes larger than Raymond's shoes, so x + 2 = Sarah's size. We also know that David's shoes are 2 sizes smaller than Sarah's, so x - 2 = David's size. We can use these equations to find x:\n\nx + 2 = Sarah's size\nx - 2 = David's size\n\nAdding 2 to both sides of the first equation and subtracting 2 from both sides of the second equation, we get:\n\nx = Sarah's size - 2\nx = David's size + 2\n\nWe can set up an equation using these expressions:\n\nSarah's size - 2 = David's size + 2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nx = x + 2 - 2\nx = x + 4\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x = x + 4\nx = 4\n\nSo, David's shoes are size 4. Since they buy 1 pair of shoes each, the total number of pairs of shoes that Raymond and David buy in total is y = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7.", "prediction": "7"}

Let's start with the number of fruits (3) and multiply it by the number of seeds per fruit (8):\n\n3 fruits x 8 seeds/fruit = 24 seeds\n\nNow, we need to add the number of seeds for each type of fruit. Since each type of fruit costs 25, we can assume that there are 25 seeds for each type of fruit. So, we add 24 seeds (from above) to 25 seeds/fruit:\n\n24 seeds + 25 seeds/fruit = 49 seeds\n\nTherefore, there are 49 seeds in total.", "prediction": "49"}

Then, she bought 5 boards for $16 each, so that's a total of $16 x 5 = $80. \n\nNow, she wants to sell all of them. The 10 boards she bought for $10 each are still worth $10 each, so that's a total of $10 x 10 = $100. The 5 boards she bought for $16 each are still worth $16 each, so that's a total of $16 x 5 = $80. \n\nTo find the profit, we need to find the total revenue from selling all the boards. The total revenue is $100 + $80 = $180. The cost of the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

{"question": "Jumla ya mshahara wa Adrien ilikuwa asilimia 30 juu ya mshahara wa Lulah. Miaka minne baadaye, mshahara wake ulikuwa umeongezeka, na alikuwa anapata 40% zaidi ya mshahara ambao alikuwa anapata miaka minne iliyopita. Ikiwa mshahara wa Adrien na Lylah uliongeleza sambamba, na Adrien alikuwa anapata $40000 miaka minne iliyopita, piga hesabu ya jumla ya mshahara ambao watu hao wawili walikuwa wanapokea miaka minne baadaye?", "answer": 95200, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given that Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lulah's salary four years ago. Let's say Lulah's salary was $100. Then Adrien's salary was $130 (30% more than $100).\n\nNext, we are told that five years later, Adrien's salary has increased, and he is getting 40% more than he was getting four years ago. Let's say Adrien's new salary is $x.\n\nWe are also given that if Adrien and Lulah's salaries increased at the same rate, and Adrien got $40000 four years ago, then we need to find the total salary of the two people five years later.\n\nLet's start by finding Adrien's new salary. We know that he got 40% more than he got four years ago. Let's say he got $y four years ago. Then he got $y + 0.4y = 1.4y$ five years ago. Since we know he got $40000 four years ago, we can set up the equation:\n\n$1.4y = 40000$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get $y = 28571.33$. Now, we can find Adrien's new salary $x$ by increasing his old salary by 40%:\n\n$x = 1.4y + 0.4 \\cdot 28571.33 = 40133.33$\n\nNow, we need to find Lulah's new salary. Since Adrien and Lulah's salaries increased at the same rate, we can assume Lulah's new salary is also $x$. However, we know that Adrien's new salary is $40133.33$, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$x = 40133.33$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 40133.33$. Therefore, the total salary of the two people five years later is $x + y = 40133.33 + 28571.33 = \\boxed{68604.67}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 68604.67.

The question is asking about the profit hospital gets from these trips.\n2. The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, and doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour.\n3. Each patient is treated for an average of 24 minutes, which means the hospital treats 500 patients per day.\n4. The hospital gets a profit from the difference between what it charges patients and what it pays doctors.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we can multiply the number of patients by the time they are treated, and then multiply the result by the difference between the patient charge and the doctor's charge:\n\nProfit = (500 patients/day) x (24 minutes/day) x ($200 - $150) = $200,000\n\nSo, the hospital gets a profit of $200,000 per day from these trips.", "prediction": "200000"}

So, we need to find the total number of chips in the bag.\n3. The snake took 4 more chips after Dave ate 10, which means there were 10 + 4 = 14 chips left in the bag.\n4. The rat took 2/3 of the remaining chips, which is 14 - 2/3 = 10 chips.\n5. The ants took 3 chips from the plate, but we don't know how many chips were on the plate in the first place. Let's call the number of chips on the plate x.\n6. The story tells us that the ants took 3 chips, so x - 3 = 3. Solving for x, we get x = 6.\n7.

The question is asking how much money Mendy should give Benedict if he can pay back the loan after 3 months.\n\nNext, let's think step-by-step about the question. We know that Mendy borrowed $100 and agreed to pay 2% interest per month. After 3 months, Mendy will have paid 6 months' worth of interest. To find out how much Mendy needs to pay back, we need to calculate the total amount of interest he will have paid.\n\nLet's assume the interest is compounded monthly, which means the interest is added to the principal amount at the end of each month. After 3 months, the total amount of interest paid will be:\n\n6 months x 2% = 6 x 0.02 = $1.20\n\nNow, we need to add the interest to the principal amount to find the total amount Mendy needs to pay back:\n\nPrincipal amount = $100\nInterest = $1.20\nTotal amount = $100 + $1.20 = $101.20\n\nSince Mendy borrowed $100, he needs to pay back $101.20 to settle the debt.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Mendy should give Benedict $101.20.", "prediction": "101.20"}

How many bags did the seller sell?\n\nLet's think step-by-step:\n\n* The seller bought 20 bags from the farmer for $20 each, so the total cost is $20 x 20 = $400.\n* The seller sold all the bags for $30 each, and made a total profit of $400. This means the seller sold 20 bags x $30 = $600.\n* The cost of transporting the bags is $2 per bag, and this is included in the $30 price. So, the seller's profit is $600 - $400 = $200.\n* If the seller's profit is $200, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, then the seller must have sold 20 bags - $200 / $2 = 10 bags more than the number of bags that just cover the transportation cost.\n\nSo, the seller sold 10 bags more than the number of bags that just cover the transportation cost. Let's call the number of bags that just cover the transportation cost x. Then, the seller sold x + 10 bags.\n\nWe can also write an equation based on the information:\n\nx + 10 bags = 20 bags (since the seller sold 20 bags)\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides gives:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the seller sold 10 bags more than the number of bags that just cover the transportation cost.", "prediction": "10"}

This means the food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.\n* They went on 2 different trips, each costing $33.\n\nTo find out how much each friend paid, we need to divide the total costs equally among the three friends. Let's calculate the total costs:\n\n* Total cost of tickets: $20.25\n* Total cost of food: $15.75\n* Total cost of trips: $33 x 2 = $66\n\nTotal cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102\n\nSince there are 3 friends, each friend will pay:\n\n$102 ÷ 3 = $34.00\n\nSo, each friend paid $34.00.", "prediction": "34.00"}

After a month, she collected three more than that number. In the second month, the cards she collected were fewer than the ones she collected in the first month and 20. In the third month, she collected two times the total of Pokémon cards she collected in the first month and the second month. How many Pokémon cards does she have now?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards.\n* After a month, she collected 3 more, so she has 20 + 3 = 23 cards.\n* In the second month, she collected fewer cards than in the first month, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's call the number of cards she collected in the second month x. We know that x is less than 23 (since she collected fewer cards) and more than 20 (since she collected 3 more than 20). So, 20 < x < 23.\n* In the third month, she collected 2 times the total of Pokémon cards she collected in the first month and the second month. This means she collected 2(23 + x) cards. We know that she collected 20 + 3 + x cards in the first two months, so 20 + 3 + x = 23 + x. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 20 + x = 23. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us x = 3.\n* Now, we can find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now. In the third month, she collected 2(23 + 3) = 2(26) = 52 cards. Adding this to the 20 + 3 = 23 cards she had after the first month, we get 23 + 52 = 75 cards.\n\nTherefore, Elaine has 75 Pokémon cards now.", "prediction": "75"}

If each chocolate candy weighs 40 grams, what is the total weight of the candy in grams?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* We know that Joe has 25 chocolate candies and 80 lollipops.\n* Each chocolate candy weighs 40 grams, and each lollipop weighs less than that (since it's half the weight of a chocolate candy).\n* We need to find the total weight of the candy, which is the sum of the weight of the chocolate candies and the weight of the lollipops.\n\nTo find the total weight, we can start by finding the weight of the lollipops. Since there are 80 lollipops, and each lollipop weighs less than 40 grams (let's call it x grams), the total weight of the lollipops would be:\n\n80 lollipops x x grams = 80x grams\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of the chocolate candies. Since there are 25 chocolate candies, and each one weighs 40 grams, the total weight of the chocolate candies would be:\n\n25 chocolate candies x 40 grams = 1000 grams\n\nNow, we can find the total weight of the candy by adding the weight of the lollipops and the weight of the chocolate candies:\n\nTotal weight = 80x + 1000 grams\n\nWe know that the total weight is equal to 1000 + 80x. Since each chocolate candy weighs 40 grams, we can set up an equation:\n\n40 grams = 2x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 20 grams\n\nNow, we can find the total weight of the candy:\n\nTotal weight = 80x + 1000 grams\n= 80(20) + 1000 grams\n= 1600 grams + 1000 grams\n= 2600 grams\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the candy is 2600 grams.", "prediction": "2600"}

Kidimbwi kidogo kina maji kiasi gani kwa sasa?", "answer": 8, "model_output": " Let's break down the question step by step!\n\nFirst, we need to understand the situation: Jerry has two water bottles, and one of them (the big one) has more water than the other (the small one). \n\nNow, let's think about the ratio of water in the big bottle to the water in the small bottle. Initially, the big bottle had 4 times more water than the small bottle. \n\nBut, we're told that the big bottle now has 4 times more water than the small bottle. This means that the ratio of water in the big bottle to the water in the small bottle has changed. \n\nSo, the question is asking us to find the amount of water in the small bottle now. \n\nLet's say the small bottle has x amount of water. Then, the big bottle has 4x amount of water. \n\nSince the big bottle has 4x amount of water, we can set up an equation: \n\n4x = 2x + y (where y is the amount of water in the small bottle) \n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 2x = y \n\nDivide both sides by 2: x = y/2 \n\nNow, we're told that the big bottle has 4 times more water than the small bottle. So, we can set up another equation: \n\n2x + y = 4x \n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: y = 2x \n\nDivide both sides by 2: y = x \n\nSo, the small bottle has x amount of water. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. We're given that the big bottle had 4 times more water than the small bottle initially. Let's say the small bottle had z amount of water initially. Then, the big bottle had 4z amount of water. \n\nSince the big bottle now has 4x amount of water, we can set up an equation: \n\n4z = 4x \n\nDivide both sides by 4: z = x \n\nNow, we're told that the big bottle had 4 times more water than the small bottle initially. So, we can set up another equation: \n\n2z = x \n\nDivide both sides by 2: z = x/2 \n\nSo, the small bottle had x/2 amount of water initially. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. We're given that the big bottle had 4 times more water than the small bottle initially. Let's say the small bottle had z amount of water initially.

{"question": "Jason ana mpango wa simu wa dakika 1000 kila mwezi. Kila siku anapiga simu kwa dakika 15 akiongea na mdosi wake, na ameongea kwa simu dakika 300 na watu wengine mwezi huu. Jason bado amesalia na dakika ngapi ikiwa mwezi huu una siku 30?", "answer": 250, "model_output": " Let's break down the question step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to translate the question to English:\n\n\"Jason has a 1000-minute phone plan every month. He makes a 15-minute call to his friend every day, and he has spoken to others for 300 minutes this month. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?\"\n\nNow, let's think step-by-step about the question:\n\n* Jason has a 1000-minute phone plan every month.\n* He makes a 15-minute call to his friend every day.\n* He has spoken to others for 300 minutes this month.\n* This month has 30 days.\n\nTo find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used so far this month.\n\n* Jason's daily call to his friend is 15 minutes, so he has used 15 minutes per day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he has used 15 x 30 = 450 minutes for his daily calls.\n* He has also spoken to others for 300 minutes this month.\n* Add the two numbers: 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.\n* The total number of minutes Jason has used this month is 750 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many minutes Jason has left. He has 1000 minutes in his phone plan, and he has used 750 minutes so far. To find the remaining minutes, subtract the used minutes from the total plan:\n\n1000 minutes (total plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes\n\nTherefore, Jason has 250 minutes left if this month has 30 days.", "prediction": "30"}

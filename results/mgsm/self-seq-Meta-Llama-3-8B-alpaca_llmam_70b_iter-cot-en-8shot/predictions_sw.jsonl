She walks 4 miles in the first hour, then 2 miles in the next hour. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. \n\nLet's calculate her average speed: 12 miles / (1 hour + 1 hour) = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles per hour. \n\nThis is not equal to 4 miles per hour, so she needs to adjust her speed. Let's say she walks x miles in the remaining distance. Then her average speed will be 12 miles / (1 hour + 1 hour + x hours) = 12 miles / (2 + x) hours = 4 miles per hour. \n\nSolve for x: 12 / (2 + x) = 4. Multiply both sides by (2 + x) to get rid of the fraction: 12 = 8 + x.

Artie doesn't have any money that's worth less than a dollar, so he decides to make all his prices round to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 bunches of daisies, 9 bunches of petunias, and 17 bunches of begonias, how much money will he make?\n\nLet's calculate the total price of each type of flower:\n\n12 bunches of daisies x $2.74 per bunch = $33.12\n9 bunches of petunias x $1.87 per bunch = $16.83\n17 bunches of begonias x $2.12 per bunch = $36.04\n\nThe total price of all the flowers is $33.12 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $86.00.\n\nSince Artie doesn't have any money that's worth less than a dollar, he can't make any change.

Adrien had $40000 4 years ago, so his new salary is 1.82x = 40000 / 1.82 = 44000.\n5. Lulah's new salary is also 1.82x = 44000 / 1.82 = 24200.\n\nSo the total salary of the two people is 44000 + 24200 = 68200.", "prediction": "68200"}

He tries to return home at 4 pm, but he uses 2 hours of the first traffic-free time. He uses half an hour of the next time to drive at 30 miles per hour. Before he can drive the remaining time at 4 pm at 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Thought Process:**\n\n1. John wants to return home at 4 pm, but he's currently at a point where he needs to drive for 2 hours before he can reach home.\n2. During those 2 hours, he drives at 30 miles per hour, which means he covers a distance of 30 miles.\n3. After the 2 hours, he has 2 hours left to reach home, and he drives at 80 miles per hour, which means he covers a distance of 80 miles in 1 hour.\n4. To find the total distance he covers in the remaining 2 hours, we multiply the speed by the time: 80 miles/hour × 2 hours = 160 miles.\n5. Now, let's add the distance he covered in the first 2 hours (30 miles) to the distance he covers in the remaining 2 hours (160 miles): 30 miles + 160 miles = 190 miles.\n6. Since John wants to reach home at 4 pm, and he's currently at a point where he needs to drive for 2 hours, we can assume he's already driven for 2 hours. Therefore, he's 2 hours away from home at the start of the journey.\n7. To find the total distance from home, we add the distance he's already driven (2 hours) to the distance he covers in the remaining 2 hours (190 miles): 2 hours + 190 miles = 192 miles.\n8. However, the question asks for the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours, not at the start. Since John drives for 2 hours before reaching home, he'll be 2 hours away from home at the end of the 4 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is 30 miles, which is the distance he covers in the second half of the 4-hour journey.", "prediction": "4"}

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what is the speed she needs to maintain (in miles per hour) to cover the remaining distance?\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Thought Process:**\n\n1. Let's break down the information we have:\n\t* Marissa traveled 12 miles.\n\t* She took 1 hour to travel 4 miles, so her initial speed was 4 miles/hour.\n\t* She then took another hour to travel 2 miles, so her total distance traveled is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.\n\t* She has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to travel.\n2. Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles/hour. To find her average speed, we need to find the speed she needs to maintain to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour.\n3. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles/hour, we can set up a proportion:\n\t* Let x be the speed she needs to maintain to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour.\n\t* Then, we can set up the proportion: x = 4 (average speed) / 1 (hour) = 4x / 1\n\t* Simplify the proportion: x = 4\n4.

If their current total age is 162 years, calculate Allen's age in 10 years from now.\"\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question**\n\nWe are given the ages of two individuals, Darrel and Allen, who are 7 years and 11 months old, respectively. Their current total age is 162 years. We need to find Allen's age in 10 years from now.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the current age of Darrel and Allen**\n\nSince Darrel is 7 years old and Allen is 11 months old, we can calculate their current ages as follows:\n\nDarrel's age = 7 years\nAllen's age = 11 months = 1 year and 1 month (approximately)\n\nTotal current age = Darrel's age + Allen's age = 7 + 1.08 ≈ 8.08 years\n\nHowever, the question states that their total current age is 162 years, which contradicts our calculation. This means that either Darrel or Allen is not 7 years and 11 months old, or there is an error in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate the question**\n\nLet's assume that the question is correct, and we need to find a way to make the calculation work. One possible solution is to adjust the ages of Darrel and Allen to make their total current age 162 years. We can do this by adding 7 years to Darrel's age and 1 year to Allen's age:\n\nDarrel's new age = 7 + 7 = 14 years\nAllen's new age = 11 months + 1 year = 1 year and 11 months ≈ 1.83 years\n\nTotal new age = Darrel's new age + Allen's new age ≈ 15.83 years\n\nNow, we can calculate Allen's age in 10 years from now:\n\nAllen's age in 10 years = Allen's new age + 10 = 1.83 + 10 ≈ 11.83 years\n\nTherefore, Allen's age in 10 years from now is approximately 11.83 years.", "prediction": "11.83"}

It travels from 7 am in the morning to 10 pm in the evening. Then, it travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The journey back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time for the first journey**\n\nThe distance is not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume it's a reasonable distance, let's say 100 miles (since it's a full day's journey). The speed is 10 miles per hour, so we can calculate the time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 100 miles / 10 miles/hour\n= 10 hours\n\nSo, the journey from 7 am to 10 pm takes 10 hours.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the time for the return journey**\n\nThe return journey is at a speed of 6 miles per hour, and it's the same distance (100 miles). We can calculate the time again:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 100 miles / 6 miles/hour\n= 16.67 hours (approximately)\n\nSince we can't return at a fraction of an hour, we'll round up to the nearest whole hour. Therefore, it will take approximately 17 hours to return.\n\n**Step 5: Add the times together**\n\nThe total time it will take to return is the sum of the times for both journeys:\n\nTotal time = Time for the first journey + Time for the return journey\n= 10 hours + 17 hours\n= 27 hours\n\nSo, the answer is: **27 hours**.", "prediction": "27"}

The question is asking how far Sophia can drive using one tank of gasoline.\n2. The input provides information about Sophia's car, including the fact that it can hold 12 gallons of gasoline.\n3. The question states that Sophia has already driven 100 miles since the last time she filled up her tank, and she needs to add 4 more gallons to fill it up again.\n4. This implies that Sophia's car uses a certain amount of gasoline per mile, and we can use this information to calculate how far she can drive with one tank of gasoline.\n5. Since Sophia needs to add 4 more gallons to fill up her tank, and her car can hold 12 gallons, we can subtract 4 from 12 to find out how many gallons are left: 12 - 4 = 8.\n6. Therefore, Sophia can drive 8 miles with the remaining 8 gallons of gasoline in her tank.\n7. However, the question asks how far she can drive using one tank of gasoline, which means we need to consider the entire capacity of the tank, not just the remaining amount.\n8. Since the tank can hold 12 gallons, and Sophia can drive 8 miles with 8 gallons, we can multiply the number of gallons by the distance driven per gallon to find the total distance: 12 x 8 = 96 miles.\n9. Therefore, Sophia can drive 96 miles using one tank of gasoline.\n\nSo, the answer is 96 miles. However, the question asks for the distance Sophia can drive \"kwa tangi moja ya mafuta ya gari,\" which means \"with one tank of gasoline.\" Since we've already calculated the distance she can drive with one tank, the correct answer is 12 miles.", "prediction": "12"}

For the rest of the dog's life, the dog needs 2 packs per day, which is a total of 2 packs/day. Since we don't know the exact number of days left in the dog's life, we'll assume it's a full year (365 days) minus the 180 days already calculated. That's 365 - 180 = 185 days.

The question is in Swahili, so we need to translate it to English. Here's the translation:\n\n\"Two girls each got 1/6 of 24 liters of water. Then, a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water remained?\"\n\n2. Let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe know that each of the two girls got 1/6 of 24 liters of water. To find out how many liters each girl got, we can multiply 24 by 1/6:\n\n24 x 1/6 = 4 liters per girl\n\nSo, each girl got 4 liters of water.\n\nThe boy got 6 liters of water.\n\n3. Now, let's find out how many liters of water remained. We can subtract the total amount of water given to the three children from the initial amount of water:\n\n24 (initial water) - 4 (to each girl) - 6 (to the boy) = 14 liters\n\nHowever, we know that each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters, which means they got 4 liters each. So, we can rewrite the calculation:\n\n24 - 4 - 4 = 16 liters\n\nBut wait, we already calculated that each girl got 4 liters, so we can't subtract 4 from 24 twice. This is where the mistake lies. The correct calculation is:\n\n24 - 4 = 20 liters (initial water) - 4 liters (to each girl) = 16 liters\n\nSo, 16 liters of water remained.\n\nThe correct answer is: 16 liters of water remained.", "prediction": "16"}

We are given that 2/5 of 200 students are boys (since 2/5 of 200 is 2/5 × 200 = 80, and the total number of students is 200, so the number of boys is 200 - 80 = 120).\n3. We are also given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Guides.\n4. Let's find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Guides. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Guides, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Guides is 1/3 of the total number of girls.\n\nLet's call the total number of girls \"x\". Then, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Guides is 1/3x.\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 200, and the number of boys is 120. So, the number of girls is 200 - 120 = 80.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\n\n1/3x + 120 = 80\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 240 - 120 = 120\n\nSo, the total number of girls is 120.\n\nSince 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Guides, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Guides is 1/3 × 120 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 40 girls are not in the Girl Guides.", "prediction": "40"}

The final batch of eggs that Freda fried had an auntie who used 32 eggs.\"\n\n2. Let's break down the information:\n- Freda is frying eggs in a pan.\n- Each pan has an auntie who uses three eggs.\n- The final batch of eggs had an auntie who used 32 eggs.\n\n3. To find out how many eggs Freda used, we need to calculate the total number of eggs used by the aunties. Since each auntie uses three eggs, we can multiply the number of aunties by three:\n- 32 eggs (final batch) ÷ 3 eggs per auntie = 10.67 aunties (round down to 10 aunties)\n- 10 aunties × 3 eggs per auntie = 30 eggs\n\n4. However, we know that the final batch had 32 eggs, which is more than the calculated total. This means that Freda used more than 30 eggs. To find the exact number, we can subtract the calculated total from the final batch:\n- 32 eggs (final batch) - 30 eggs (calculated total) = 2 eggs\n\n5. Since Freda used 2 eggs more than the calculated total, we can add 2 to the calculated total to get the exact number of eggs used:\n- 30 eggs (calculated total) + 2 eggs = 32 eggs\n\nTherefore, Freda used 32 eggs.", "prediction": "32"}

Because of her kindness, she has decided to give 1 plant from each basket to friends and family tomorrow. How many plants will Mary have left in the basket?\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Thought Process:**\n\n1. Mary has 40 baskets in her farm enclosure, and each basket has 2 plants, so she has a total of 40 x 2 = 80 plants.\n2. She receives 18 new plants, so she now has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.\n3. She decides to give 1 plant from each basket to friends and family, which means she will give away 40 plants (1 from each of the 40 baskets).\n4. To find out how many plants she will have left, subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58 plants.\n5. However, the question asks about the number of plants she will have left in the basket, not the total number of plants she has. Since she has 40 baskets, and each basket has 2 plants, she will have 40 x 2 = 80 plants in the basket. But she will give away 1 plant from each basket, so she will have 80 - 40 = 40 plants left in the basket.\n\nTherefore, Mary will have 40 plants left in the basket.", "prediction": "40"}

This means the box is a rectangular prism with these dimensions.\n* The box has a total volume of 1 cubic inch. This means the box is very small, with a volume of just 1 cubic inch.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of the box**\n\nLet's calculate the volume of the box using the formula:\n\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\n= 5 inches × 6 inches × 4 inches\n= 120 cubic inches\n\nWait, this can't be right! The problem states the box has a total volume of 1 cubic inch, but our calculation shows it's 120 cubic inches. This means there must be some mistake. Let's try to find the mistake.\n\nHmm... I think I found it! The problem states the box has a total volume of 1 cubic inch, but our calculation shows it's 120 cubic inches. This means the unit of measurement might be incorrect. Maybe the problem meant to say the box has a total volume of 1 cubic centimeter (cm³) instead of 1 cubic inch (in³).\n\nSo, let's convert 1 cubic inch to cubic centimeters:\n\n1 cubic inch × (1 cubic centimeter / 0.0005787 cubic inches) = 0.0005787 cubic centimeters\n\nNow, let's recalculate the volume of the box:\n\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\n= 5 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm\n= 120 cm³\n\nAh-ha!

Therefore, we can compare the total number of seeds to find the total number of fruits.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits**\n\nLet's compare the total number of seeds:\n\n48 (Beatrice's seeds) > 42 (Marcel's seeds)\n\nThis means that Beatrice's fruits have more seeds, so we can conclude that Beatrice has more fruits.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average number of fruits**\n\nSince we don't know the exact number of fruits, we can't calculate the exact average. However, we can say that they will eat more fruits than Marcel, but less than Beatrice. To find the average, we can take the midpoint between the two extremes:\n\n(48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45\n\nSo, on average, they will eat 45 fruits.\n\n**Answer: 2.5**\n\nThe correct answer is 2.5, but since we can't have a fraction of a fruit, we can round it up to 3 or down to 2, depending on the context. In this case, I'll choose 2.5 as the most accurate answer.", "prediction": "2.5"}
{"question": "Mashua ya Julia yalianza kuvuja wakati alikuwa kwenye ziwa. Mashua hayo yalikuwa yanaingiza lita mbili za maji kwa kila futi kumi alivuta makasi akirejea ufuo.

Mashua hayo yalikuwa yameingiza maji kiasi gani wakati ambapo Julia alifika kwenye ufuo?", "answer": 16, "model_output": " Mashua hayo yalikuwa yameingiza maji kiasi gani wakati ambapo Julia alifika kwenye ufuo?\n\nLet's break down the question step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Translate the question to English**\n\nThe question is already in Swahili, so we don't need to translate it. However, I'll provide a summary of the question:\n\nThe question is asking about the amount of water that Mashua (a type of boat) had pumped into the lake when Julia reached the lake.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question**\n\nThe question provides some information about Mashua:\n\n* It pumped 2 liters of water per foot of pipe when Julia was on the lake.\n* Julia reached the lake after 10 seconds of pumping.\n* The distance from the lake to the point where Julia reached the lake was 64 seconds.\n\n**Step 3: Answer the question**\n\nTo find the amount of water pumped into the lake, we need to calculate the distance traveled by Julia in 10 seconds. Since Julia reached the lake after 10 seconds, we can assume that Julia traveled at a constant speed. Let's calculate the distance:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 64 seconds × (unknown speed)\n\nWe don't know the speed, but we can use the information that Julia reached the lake after 10 seconds. Since Julia traveled 64 seconds to reach the lake, and it took 10 seconds to pump 2 liters of water per foot of pipe, we can set up a proportion:\n\n64 seconds ÷ 10 seconds = unknown speed × 2 liters/foot × 1 foot (assuming 1 foot of pipe)\n\nSimplifying the proportion, we get:\n\n64 ÷ 10 = unknown speed × 2\n\nunknown speed = 64 ÷ 10 = 6.4\n\nSo, Julia traveled at a speed of 6.4 feet per second.\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance traveled by Julia in 10 seconds:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 6.4 feet/second × 10 seconds = 64 feet\n\nSince Mashua pumped 2 liters of water per foot of pipe, we can calculate the total amount of water pumped into the lake:\n\nTotal water pumped = Distance × Volume per foot = 64 feet × 2 liters/foot = 128 liters\n\nTherefore, Mashua pumped 128 liters of water into the lake when Julia reached the lake.", "prediction": "128"}

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is equal to 24/60 = 0.4 hours. Since there are 500 patients, the total number of hours worked per day is 500 x 0.4 = 200 hours.\n* Hourly wage: The doctors charge $150 per hour, and patients charge $200 per hour. Let's assume the hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour and receives $200 per hour from the patients. The total hourly wage is $150 (doctors) + $200 (patients) = $350 per hour.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue**\n\nNow, let's multiply the number of hours worked per day by the hourly wage:\n\nTotal revenue = 200 hours x $350/hour = $70,000 per day\n\nTherefore, the hospital makes a total revenue of $70,000 per day from these trips.", "prediction": "70000"}

Kim sells a product that requires two chlorine tanks and one fabric softener for each customer's home. The cost of these materials is $2 per chlorine tank and $5 per fabric softener. The question wants to know how much Kim will earn per week.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. Kim has 3 customers already, and she's talking to 5 more potential customers. She feels confident to increase her sales.\n2. Each customer needs 2 chlorine tanks and 1 fabric softener, so the total cost of materials per customer is:\n2 chlorine tanks x $2/tank = $4\n1 fabric softener x $5 = $5\nTotal cost per customer = $4 + $5 = $9\n3. Since Kim has 3 customers already and is talking to 5 more, the total number of customers is:\n3 (existing) + 5 (new) = 8 customers\n4. The total cost of materials per week is:\n8 customers x $9/customer = $72\n5. Kim will earn a profit, which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost of materials:\nTotal revenue = Total cost of materials + Profit\n$72 (total cost of materials) + Profit = $92 (total revenue)\n6. Therefore, Kim will earn $92 per week.\n\n**Answer:** Kim will earn $92 per week.", "prediction": "92"}

John can harvest maize after every 3 months. How many bags of maize can John harvest per year?\"\n\n2. Let's analyze the question:\n\n* John has 10 hectares of land for maize.\n* There are 100 bags of maize per hectare, so the total number of bags per 10 hectares is:\n10 hectares x 100 bags/ha = 1000 bags\n* John can harvest maize after every 3 months, which means he can harvest 4 times a year (since 1 year has 4 seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter).\n* To find out how many bags John can harvest per year, we multiply the total number of bags by the number of harvests per year:\n1000 bags x 4 harvests/year = 4000 bags/year\nHowever, the question asks for the number of bags per year, not per harvest. Since John harvests 4 times a year, we divide the total number of bags by 4:\n4000 bags/year ÷ 4 = 1000 bags/year\n\nTherefore, John can harvest 1000 bags of maize per year.", "prediction": "1000"}

Let's analyze the problem:\n\n* The farmer eats all the bananas in his farm, so we need to find out how many bananas he needs to order from the neighboring farm.\n* The farmer asks for bananas every two months, so we need to calculate the number of bananas needed for two months.\n* The number of bananas needed per month is:\n\t+ For humans: 100 bananas\n\t+ For cows: 400 bananas\n\t+ Total: 100 + 400 = 500 bananas per month\n* Since the farmer asks for bananas every two months, we need to multiply the total number of bananas needed per month by 2:\n\t+ 500 bananas per month × 2 = 1000 bananas for two months\n* However, the question asks for the number of bananas needed to order for two months, which is different from the total number of bananas needed for two months. To find the answer, we need to consider the number of bananas needed to order in a single month. Since the farmer asks for bananas every two months, we can divide the total number of bananas needed for two months by 2:\n\t+ 1000 bananas for two months ÷ 2 = 500 bananas per month\n\t+ Since the farmer asks for bananas every two months, we need to order half of the total number of bananas needed for two months in a single month.

A red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, and a white chicken lays 5 eggs per day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does Jerry have?\"\n\n2. Let's analyze the information:\n\n* Jerry has a red chicken and a white chicken, so he has 1 red chicken and 1 white chicken initially.\n* A red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, and a white chicken lays 5 eggs per day. So, Jerry collects 3 + 5 = 8 eggs per day initially.\n* Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, he must have 42 ÷ 8 = 5.25 days' worth of eggs. This means Jerry has 5.25 days' worth of eggs, which is equivalent to 5.25 chickens (assuming each chicken lays eggs for 1 day).\n\n3. The question asks how many red chickens Jerry has if he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens. Let's call the number of red chickens \"x\". Then, the number of white chickens is x + 2.\n\nSince each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:\n\n5(x + 2) = 42\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5x + 10 = 42\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides gives us:\n\n5x = 32\n\nDividing both sides by 5 gives us:\n\nx = 6.4\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a chicken, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate his farm.\n3. This means Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank.\n4. The problem states that Celine collects rainwater, which is twice more than the water that was left. This implies that the water left in the tank is half of the rainwater collected.\n5. Let's call the amount of rainwater collected \"x\". Since it's twice more than the water left, we can set up the equation: x = 2 × (water left)\n6. We know Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the water left is the initial amount minus the used water: water left = 120 - 90 = 30 liters\n7. Now, we can find the amount of rainwater collected: x = 2 × 30 = 60 liters\n8. The problem asks how many liters of water are left in the tank now.

It mentions three scenarios:\n   - 36 penguins are in the sun.\n   - One of them is swimming in the ocean.\n   - Another one is eating its evening meal on the beach.\n\n3. Analyze the scenarios:\nFrom the scenarios, we can infer that 36 penguins are initially in the sun. One of them is swimming in the ocean, which means it's not in the sun anymore. Another one is eating on the beach, which is also not in the sun.\n\n4. Calculate the number of penguins left in the sun:\nSince one penguin is swimming in the ocean and another is eating on the beach, we need to subtract these two from the initial 36.

Answer the question:\nTo find out how long it takes Mike to write 2 letters per week, we need to multiply the number of letters he writes per week (2) by the time it takes him to write one page (6 minutes). Since each letter is 5 pages long, we need to multiply 2 by 5 to get the total number of pages he writes per week (2 x 5 = 10 pages). Then, we multiply the number of pages per week by the time it takes him to write one page (10 pages x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes).

Let's break down the information we have:\n\t* Jason makes a 15-minute phone call every day, which means he makes 15 calls per day.\n\t* He has talked to his friend for 300 minutes this month.\n\t* He has a total of 1000 minutes of phone calls per month.\n2. Let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has already spoken:\n\t* 300 minutes (talking to others) + 15 minutes (daily calls) = 315 minutes\n3. Since Jason has already spoken 315 minutes, and he has 1000 minutes in total, we can subtract the already spoken minutes from the total:\n\t* 1000 minutes - 315 minutes = 685 minutes\n4. There are 30 days in the month. To find out how many minutes are left, we'll divide the remaining minutes by the number of days:\n\t* 685 minutes ÷ 30 days = 23 minutes per day\n5.

Translate the question to English:\nThe question is in Swahili, and it's a bit long, but I'll translate it into English for better understanding.\n\n\"Jumatatu, Sue alikula biskuti mara 4 zaidi ya dadake.\" means \"On Monday, Sue ate 4 more biscuits than dadake.\"\n\"Jumanne, alikula biskuti mara mbili zaidi ya dadake.\" means \"On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 more biscuits than dadake.\"\n\"Dadake alikula biskuti 5 Jumatatu na 13 siku iliyofuata.\" means \"Dadake ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 days later.\"\n\"Ikiwa biskuti 1 ina kalori 200, Sue alikula kalori ngapi zaidi ya dadake?\" means \"If 1 biscuit has 200 calories, how many calories did Sue eat more than dadake?\"\n\n2. Analyze the information:\nLet's analyze the information we have:\n\n* Sue ate 4 more biscuits than dadake on Monday.\n* Sue ate 2 more biscuits than dadake on Tuesday.\n* Dadake ate 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 days later.\n* 1 biscuit has 200 calories.\n\n3. Calculate the total calories:\nLet's calculate the total calories Sue ate:\n\n* On Monday, Sue ate 4 more biscuits than dadake, so Sue ate 4 biscuits.\n* On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 more biscuits than dadake, so Sue ate 2 biscuits.\n* Total biscuits eaten by Sue = 4 (Monday) + 2 (Tuesday) = 6 biscuits.\n* Total calories eaten by Sue = 6 biscuits × 200 calories/biscuit = 1200 calories.\n\n4. Calculate the difference:\nNow, let's find out how many calories Sue ate more than dadake:\n\n* Dadake ate 5 biscuits on Monday, and Sue ate 4 biscuits on Monday, so Sue ate 1 biscuit less than dadake on Monday.\n* On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 biscuits more than dadake.\n* Total difference = 1 biscuit (Monday) + 2 biscuits (Tuesday) = 3 biscuits.\n* Total calories difference = 3 biscuits × 200 calories/biscuit = 600 calories.\n\nAnswer: Sue ate 600 calories more than dadake.", "prediction": "600"}

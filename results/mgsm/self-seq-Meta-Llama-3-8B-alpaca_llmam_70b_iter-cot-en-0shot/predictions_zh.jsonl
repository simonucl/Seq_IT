So far, so good.\n\nNext, he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. This means he scored 4 points in 20 minutes, which is a rate of 4 points per 20 minutes.\n\nIn the last 20 minutes, his score increased by 25%. This means his score in the last 20 minutes is 25% higher than his score in the first 20 minutes. Let's call his score in the first 20 minutes x. Then, his score in the last 20 minutes is x + (25/100)x = 1.25x.\n\nNow, let's calculate his total score. He played for 40 minutes, and his score in the last 20 minutes is 1.25x. So, his total score is 40 minutes x (x + 1.25x) = 80x + 50 minutes. Since we know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, we can set up an equation: 20x + 4 = 80x + 50. Simplifying the equation, we get 60x = 46, so x = 23.33.\n\nNow, we can find his total score: 40x + 50 = 80x + 50, so his total score is 80x + 50 = 80(23.33) + 50 = 529 + 50 = 579.\n\nTherefore, Michael's total score is 579.", "prediction": "579"}

Her jumping speed is half her running speed. If she can jump 3 miles per hour, then in 6 hours, she will spend 1/3 of the time running, 2/3 of the time walking. We need to find the total distance she covers.\n\nLet's say her walking speed is x. Then her running speed is 4x. Her jumping speed is 2x. Since she can jump 3 miles per hour, we can set up an equation: 2x = 3. We solve for x: x = 3/2.\n\nNow, we can find the total distance she covers in 6 hours. She will run for 1/3 of the time, so she will run for 6/3 = 2 hours. During this time, she will cover a distance of 4x = 4(3/2) = 6 miles. She will walk for 2/3 of the time, so she will walk for 6/2 = 3 hours. During this time, she will cover a distance of x = 3/2 miles.

Since the dragon's fire range is 1,000 feet in diameter, the distance from the center of the fire range to the edge of the fire range is 500 feet (since it's a circle, the distance from the center to the edge is half the diameter).\n\nWhen Poly throws the golden sword with the blue gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet away. This means that the distance from the center of the fire range to the point where the golden sword lands is 500 feet - 400 feet = 100 feet.\n\nSince the golden sword is thrown from the point where Poly stands, the distance from Poly to the point where the golden sword lands is also 100 feet.\n\nSo, Poly can stand 100 feet away from the dragon's fire range when she uses the golden sword to hit the dragon, assuming she has the blue gemstone.\n\nAnswer: 100 feet", "prediction": "100"}

We want to find out how many miles Sophia can travel with 1 gallon of gasoline.\n\nTo do this, we can set up a ratio:\n\nDistance traveled per gallon = Total distance traveled ÷ Number of gallons consumed\n\nIn this case, the total distance traveled is 100 miles, and the number of gallons consumed is 4 (since 1 gallon is not enough to fill up the tank).\n\nSo, the distance traveled per gallon is:\n\n100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon\n\nNow, if Sophia has 1 gallon of gasoline, she can travel:\n\n25 miles per gallon × 1 gallon = 25 miles\n\nTherefore, 1 gallon of gasoline can let Sophia travel 25 miles.", "prediction": "25"}

So, the number of female students who are not Girl Scouts is x - 2/3x = 1/3x.\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 200, and the number of male students is 80. So, the number of female students is 200 - 80 = 120.

The price of each watermelon is 3 times the price of each pepper. The price of each orange is 5 dollars less than the price of each watermelon.\n\nLet's say the price of each pepper is x. Then the price of each watermelon is 3x. Let's also say the price of each orange is 3x - 5.\n\nDragon needs to buy 4 watermelons, so he needs to pay 4(3x) = 12x. He also needs to buy 20 peppers, so he needs to pay 20x. He also needs to buy 10 oranges, so he needs to pay 10(3x - 5) = 30x - 50.\n\nIn total, Dragon needs to pay 12x + 20x + 30x - 50 = 62x - 50.\n\nThe problem states that each pepper costs 15 dollars, so x = 15. Now, we can calculate the total cost:\n\n62x - 50 = 62(15) - 50\n= 930 - 50\n= 880\n\nSo, Dragon needs to pay 880 dollars.", "prediction": "880"}
{"question": "一家医院每天接诊 500 人。每位患者的看诊时长平均为 24 分钟。医生对医院收费每小时 150 美元，医院对患者收费每小时 200 美元。医院从这些就诊中获得多少利润？", "answer": 10000, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we are told that the hospital sees 500 patients per day. Let's assume this means 500 patients x 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes per day.\n\nNext, we are told that doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Let's assume this means the hospital earns $150 per hour from the doctors, and $200 per hour from the patients.\n\nTo find the total revenue, we need to calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients. Since there are 12,000 minutes per day, we can divide this by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) to get 200 hours per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue:\n\nHospital revenue from doctors: 200 hours x $150 per hour = $30,000\nHospital revenue from patients: 200 hours x $200 per hour = $40,000\n\nTotal hospital revenue: $30,000 + $40,000 = $70,000\n\nThe hospital's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the cost of seeing the patients, which is not given in the problem. However, we can calculate the profit per patient as the difference between the revenue per patient and the cost per patient. Since there are 500 patients per day, the total cost would be $500 x $24 = $12,000. The profit per patient would be ($200 - $24) = $176. The total profit would be 500 patients x $176 = $88,000.\n\nSo, the hospital's profit from seeing 500 patients per day is $88,000.", "prediction": "88000"}

Two weeks later, Ashlyn returned to the farm and found that 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe. This means 1/4 of the remaining watermelons were still not ripe.\n5. To find out how many watermelons were still not ripe, we need to calculate 1/4 of the remaining watermelons. Let's call the number of remaining watermelons \"x\".\n\nAt the beginning, there were 120 watermelons. Ashlyn picked 30% of them, so 70% remained. Then, 2 weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe, so 1/4 of the remaining watermelons were still not ripe.\n\nTo find x, we can set up an equation:\n\nx = (1/4) × (70% of 120)\n\nx = (1/4) × 0.7 × 120\n\nx = 0.7 × 30\n\nx = 21\n\nSo, 21 watermelons were still not ripe when Ashlyn returned to the farm two weeks later.", "prediction": "21"}

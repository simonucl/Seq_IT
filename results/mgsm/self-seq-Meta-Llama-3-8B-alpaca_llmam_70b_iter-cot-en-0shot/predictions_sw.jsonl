{"question": "Kiwango cha Eliza kila saa kwa saa 40 za kwanza anazofanya kazi kila wiki ni $10. Pia anapokea malipo ya muda wa ziada ya mara 1.2 ya malipo yake ya kawaida ya saa. Iwapo Eliza alifanya kazi kwa saa 45 wiki hii, mapato yake ya wiki hii ni ngapi?", "answer": 460, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given that Eliza works 40 hours a day, 10 hours a week, and earns $10 per hour. So, her total weekly income is $10 x 40 = $400.\n\nThen, we are told that she also receives an additional payment of 1.2 times her usual hourly rate for overtime. This means that for every hour she works, she gets 1.2 times the usual rate. Let's call the usual rate $x$. Then, she gets 1.2x for each hour.\n\nSince she works 45 hours a week instead of 40, she will get 1.2x x 45 = 54x as overtime payment.\n\nNow, we need to find the total income for this week. This is the sum of her usual payment and the overtime payment: $400 (usual payment) + 54x (overtime payment).\n\nWe are asked to find the total income for this week, so we need to find the value of x. We can set up an equation using the given information:\n\n$400 + 54x = 450\n\nSubtract 400 from both sides:\n\n54x = 50\n\nDivide both sides by 54:\n\nx = 50/54\n\nx = 9.33\n\nNow, we can find the total income for this week:\n\n$400 + 54x = $400 + 54 x 9.33 = $450\n\nSo, the total income for this week is $450.", "prediction": "450"}

The program was released 60 times in the first month.\n2. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.\n3. However, it decreased by 30% in the third month.\n\nTo find the total number of downloads in the three months, we need to find the number of downloads in the second month and then subtract 30% of that number to get the number of downloads in the third month.\n\nLet's say the number of downloads in the first month is x. Then, the number of downloads in the second month is 3x.\n\nIn the third month, the number of downloads is 3x - (30/100) \\* 3x = 3x - 0.9x = 2.1x.\n\nSo, the total number of downloads in the three months is x + 3x + 2.1x = 5.1x.\n\nSince we know that the program was released 60 times in the first month, x = 60.

We need to find out how many are left.\n\nLet's think about it:\n\n* Melanie started with 10 cleaning supplies.\n* She used 5 of them to clean 3 houses. This means she used 5 cleaning supplies to clean 3 houses, so each cleaning supply was used to clean 1.33 houses (3 houses / 5 cleaning supplies).\n* Since each cleaning supply was used to clean 1.33 houses, Melanie has 10 cleaning supplies x 1.33 houses per supply = 13.3 houses left to clean.\n\nSo, Melanie has 13.3 cleaning supplies left.

{"question": "Mercy akifanya kazi katika kampuni moja kwa miaka 40, atapata malipo ya uzeeni ya kila mwaka ya $50,000 kwa mwaka. Kuanzia baada ya miaka 20, anakuwa na haki ya kupata 5% ya thamani ya malipo ya uzeeni kila mwaka. Akiacha kazi baada ya miaka 30, malipo yake ya uzeeni ya kila mwaka yatakuwa ngapi?", "answer": 25000, "model_output": " Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, Mercy works at the company for 40 years, earning a yearly salary of $50,000. This means she earns a total of $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000 over 40 years.\n\nNext, starting from year 20, Mercy is entitled to a 5% bonus on her yearly salary. This means she gets an additional 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. This bonus is given every year for the next 10 years, from year 20 to 29.\n\nNow, let's calculate Mercy's total earnings. She earns $2,000,000 over 40 years, plus an additional $2,500 every year for 10 years. To calculate the total, we can add the two amounts:\n\n$2,000,000 + $2,500 x 10 = $2,000,000 + $25,000 = $2,025,000\n\nSo, Mercy's total earnings are $2,025,000.\n\nFinally, we need to find out what Mercy's yearly salary would be if she left the company after 30 years. To do this, we can calculate the yearly salary she would have earned if she had worked for 30 years, instead of 40:\n\n$50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000\n\nSince Mercy has already earned $2,025,000, we can subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount to find the difference:\n\n$2,025,000 - $1,500,000 = $525,000\n\nThis is the amount Mercy would have earned if she had left the company after 30 years. Therefore, her yearly salary would be $525,000.", "prediction": "525000"}

The company charges $140 per month for the service.\n2. They charge this amount for the first half of the year (6 months).\n3. Then, they charge a smaller amount for the remaining 10% of the year.\n\nTo find the total amount Aleena paid for the service at the end of the year, we need to calculate the total amount she paid for the 6 months and then multiply it by 1.1 (to account for the 10% extra).\n\nLet's assume the year has 12 months. For the first 6 months, Aleena pays:\n$140 x 6 = $840\n\nFor the remaining 6 months, she pays a smaller amount, which is 10% of the original amount:\n$840 x 0.10 = $84\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount she paid for the year:\n$840 + $84 = $924\n\nSo, Aleena paid a total of $924 for the service at the end of the year.", "prediction": "924"}

Ikiwa Sylvie alifikisha miaka 5 katika kampuni hiyo Desemba iliyopita, mshahara wake wa kila mwaka baada ya miaka mitatu zaidi ya kuhudumia kampuni hiyo ni ngapi?", "answer": 9360, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The company pays each employee $600 per month. This means that the monthly salary for an employee who has been working for the company for 5 years is $600.\n2. The company increases the salary of each employee by 10% of their original salary every year. This means that the salary of an employee who has been working for the company for 5 years will increase by 10% of the original salary, which is $600.\n3. The problem states that Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years, so she is eligible for the salary increase.\n4. The company increases the salary by 10% of the original salary, which is $600. To find the increase, multiply $600 by 0.10 (10%):\n$600 x 0.10 = $60\n5. Add the increase to the original salary to find the new salary:\n$600 + $60 = $660\n6. The problem asks for the salary after 3 more years of service, so we need to add another 3 years to Sylvie's 5 years of service. This means that she will get another 3 salary increases of 10% each.\n7. Calculate the next 3 increases:\n$660 (year 6) = $660 x 0.10 = $66\n$726 (year 7) = $726 x 0.10 = $72.60\n$798 (year 8) = $798 x 0.10 = $79.80\n8. Add the increases to the original salary to find the new salary:\n$660 (year 6) = $726 (year 7) = $798 (year 8)\n9. The answer is $798.

So, the total number of cars on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10 cars.\n\nOn the second day, more containers were brought, and the total number of cars in the harbor is 30. Let's say the new containers brought on the second day are x containers. Then, the total number of cars brought on the second day is x x 5 = 30 - 10 = 20 cars.\n\nSince each container has 5 cars, we can set up an equation:\n\nx x 5 = 20\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 20 / 5\nx = 4\n\nSo, 4 containers were brought on the second day.\n\nThe question asks us to find the number of containers that were purchased from outside the country on the second day.

Ikiwa mshahara wa Adrien na Lylah uliongeleza sambamba, na Adrien alikuwa anapata $40000 miaka minne iliyopita, piga hesabu ya jumla ya mshahara ambao watu hao wawili walikuwa wanapokea miaka minne baadaye?", "answer": 95200, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% more than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let's say Lylah's salary four years ago was x. Then Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3x.\n2. Five years ago, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. Let's say the increase was y. Then Adrien's salary five years ago was 1.3x + y.\n3. The problem states that Adrien's current salary is equal to 1.4 times his salary five years ago. So, we can set up the equation: 1.4(1.3x + y) = 40000.\n4. Simplify the equation: 1.3x + y = 40000 / 1.4 = 28571.33 (approximately).\n5. Now, we need to find the total salary of the two people five years ago. Since Lylah's salary five years ago was x, the total salary of the two people five years ago was (1.3x + y).\n6. Substitute the value of (1.3x + y) found earlier: (1.3x + y) = 28571.33.\n7. To find the total salary of the two people five years ago, we need to find x. We can set up the equation: 1.3x + y = 28571.33.\n8. Simplify the equation: 1.3x = 28571.33 - y.\n9. Since we don't have a value for y, we can't find a specific value for x. However, we can say that x is between 0 and 28571.33, since y is positive.\n\nSo, the answer is that the total salary of the two people five years ago is between 0 and 28571.33.", "prediction": "28571.33"}

Since Steve lives farther away from Tim, he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from school. If Tim can use his slingshot to shoot marbles at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser arrives home?\n\nLet's think about the speeds and distances involved. Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, which is a speed of 71.33 miles per hour. Tim can shoot marbles at 264 feet per minute, which is a speed of 39.33 miles per hour. Since Steve lives 3 miles from school, he can ride his bike for 3 miles in 3 minutes, or 1 mile in 1 minute. Tim, on the other hand, can shoot marbles for 2 miles in 2 minutes, or 1 mile in 1 minute.\n\nNow, let's think about the scenario. Tim wants to wait at home for Steve to arrive. Since Steve is riding his bike faster than Tim can shoot marbles, Steve will arrive at home before Tim. Let's say Steve arrives at home at time t. Then, Tim will wait for t minutes at home before Steve arrives. We can set up an equation to find t.\n\nLet's say Steve rides his bike at a speed of s miles per hour, and Tim shoots marbles at a speed of t miles per hour. Then, Steve will ride his bike for (3 miles) / s hours to get home, and Tim will wait for t hours at home. We can set up an equation:\n\n(3 miles) / s hours = t hours\n\nWe know that s = 440 feet per minute, so s = 71.33 miles per hour. We also know that t = 264 feet per minute, so t = 39.33 miles per hour. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n(3 miles) / 71.33 miles/hour = t hours\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = (3 miles) / 71.33 miles/hour\nt = 42.19 minutes\n\nSo, the winner will wait for 42.19 minutes at home before the loser arrives home.", "prediction": "42.19"}

Bill akiunganisha bidhaa hizo zote kwa mstari moja, mstari huo utakuwa na urefu wa futi ngapi?", "answer": 280, "model_output": " \n\nLet's break down the question step by step:\n\n* Bill huoka skonzi 300, kroisanti 120 za chokoleti, na bageti 60 kila siku. This means Bill has 300 boxes of pencils, 120 boxes of chocolates, and 60 bags of apples per day.\n* Kila skonzi ina urefu wa inchi 4, kila kroisanti ina urefu wa inchi 6, na kila bageti ina urefu wa futi mbili. This means each box of pencils is 4 inches tall, each box of chocolates is 6 inches tall, and each bag of apples is 2 feet tall.\n\nTo find the total height of the stack, we need to add up the heights of all the items. Since the items are stacked on top of each other, we can simply add up the heights of each item to get the total height.\n\nLet's start with the shortest item, which is the bag of apples. It's 2 feet tall. Then, we add the height of the box of pencils, which is 4 inches. So, the total height so far is 2 feet + 4 inches = 2 feet 4 inches.\n\nNext, we add the height of the box of chocolates, which is 6 inches. So, the total height is now 2 feet 4 inches + 6 inches = 2 feet 10 inches.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can divide the total height in inches by 12 to get the total height in feet.\n\nTotal height in inches = 2 feet 10 inches = 2 x 12 + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34 inches\nTotal height in feet = 34 inches ÷ 12 = 2 feet 10 inches ÷ 12 = 2 feet 2.33 inches\n\nSo, the total height of the stack is 2 feet 2.33 inches.", "prediction": "2.33"}

Iwapo walipata faida ya $25, walitumia pesa ngapi kununua limanu?", "answer": 15, "model_output": " Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe question asks how much money Juan needs to buy lemons if he gets a profit of $25.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much money Juan spends on lemons. Let's call the number of gallons of lemon juice Juan buys \"x\". Then, he spends $3 per gallon on lemons, so the total amount he spends on lemons is $3x.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Juan spends on sugar. He buys sugar in gallons too, and each gallon costs $2. Let's call the number of gallons of sugar Juan buys \"y\". The total amount he spends on sugar is $2y.\n\nJuan also buys glasses, and each glass costs $0.50. He buys 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses he buys is 20x. The total amount he spends on glasses is $0.50 \\cdot 20x.\n\nThe total amount Juan spends on lemons, sugar, and glasses is $3x + $2y + $0.50 \\cdot 20x. We know that Juan gets a profit of $25, so this amount must be equal to $25. Let's call the profit $P = 25.\n\n$3x + $2y + $0.50 \\cdot 20x = P\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x and y that satisfies this equation. We can start by simplifying the equation:\n\n$3x + $2y + $10x = P\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$13x + $2y = P\n\nSubtract $2y from both sides:\n\n$13x = P - $2y\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\nx = (P - $2y) / 13\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of P = 25:\n\nx = (25 - $2y) / 13\n\nTo find the value of y, we can use the fact that Juan buys 20 glasses per gallon of lemon juice. So, the total number of glasses he buys is 20x. We know that Juan spends $0.50 on each glass, so the total amount he spends on glasses is $0.50 \\cdot 20x. This amount must be equal to the profit, so:\n\n$0.50 \\cdot 20x = P\n\nSubstitute x = (25 - $2y) / 13:\n\n$0.50 \\cdot 20((25 - $2y) / 13) = 25\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$1 \\cdot 25 - $2y = 25\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n$2y = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can find the value of x:\n\nx = (25 - $2y) / 13\nx = (25 - $2(0)) / 13\nx = 25 / 13\nx = 2\n\nSo, Juan buys 2 gallons of lemon juice. The cost of 2 gallons of lemon juice is $3 \\cdot 2 = $6. The cost of 2 gallons of sugar is $2 \\cdot 2 = $4. The cost of 20 glasses is $0.50 \\cdot 20 = $10. The total cost is $6 + $4 + $10 = $20. Since Juan gets a profit of $25, he must have spent $20 - $25 = -$5. This is not possible, because Juan cannot spend a negative amount of money. Therefore, the answer is that Juan cannot buy lemons and make a profit of $25.", "prediction": "25"}

Muuzaji ananunua mifuko ya unga ngano kutoka kwa mkulima kwa kiwango cha $20 kwa kila mfuko. This means that the total cost of the wheat bags is $20 each, so the total cost of all the bags is $20 x number of bags.\n2. Ikiwa gharama ya kusafirisha kila mfuko kutoka shambani mpaka kwenye ghala ni $2, this is the transportation cost for each bag. Since we don't know the number of bags, we can't calculate the total transportation cost yet.\n3. na muuzaji alipata faida ya jumla ya $400 baada ya kuuza mifuko yote kwa bei ya $30 kila mfuko. This means that the total revenue from selling all the bags is $30 x number of bags, and the total profit is $400.\n4. aliuza mifuko mingapi? To find the number of bags sold, we can set up an equation: $30 x number of bags = $400. Divide both sides by 30: number of bags = $400 / $30 = 13.33.

They went on 2 different trips, each costing $33.\n\nTo find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate how much each friend paid for the tickets, food, and trips.\n\nLet's assume the price of the tickets was $x. Then, the price of the food was $x - 4.50.\n\nThe total amount they spent on tickets was 3 x $x = 3x.\nThe total amount they spent on food was 3 x ($x - 4.50) = 3x - 13.50.\nThe total amount they spent on trips was 2 x $33 = $66.\n\nThe total amount they spent in total was 3x + 3x - 13.50 + $66 = 6x - 13.50 + $66 = 6x + $52.50.\n\nWe know that they spent $20.25 on tickets, so 6x = 20.25.

Mark hutengeneza pesa ngapi kwa wiki, kwa senti?\n\nLet's break down the question step by step:\n\nMark is a printer who prints a different number of copies of a sentence every week for two different publishers, each paying a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A pays. Mark prints a total of 1000 copies of the sentence every week, and Publisher A pays 5 dollars per sentence. How much money does Mark earn per week in total?\n\nLet's start by calculating how much Mark earns from Publisher A:\n\nMark earns 5 dollars per sentence from Publisher A. Since Mark prints 1000 copies of the sentence, Mark earns 5 x 1000 = 5000 dollars from Publisher A.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much Mark earns from Publisher B:\n\nMark earns 2 x 5 = 10 dollars per sentence from Publisher B. Since Mark prints 1000 copies of the sentence, Mark earns 10 x 1000 = 10,000 dollars from Publisher B.\n\nIn total, Mark earns 5000 + 10,000 = 15,000 dollars per week.

{"question": "Mark ananunua magari 12 katika kampuni yake. Kila gari linauzwa kwa $20,000. Analipa ushuru wa 10% wa magari hayo na kisha $1000 ya usajili kwa kila moja yao. Jumla ya pesa alizolipia kila kitu ni ngapi?", "answer": 276000, "model_output": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to count the number of cars. The question says \"Mark ananuoa magari 12 katika kampuni yake\", which means there are 12 cars in the company. Let's write this down:\n\n12 cars\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays for each car. The question says \"Kila gari linauzwa kwa $20,000\", which means the company pays $20,000 for each car. Let's multiply the number of cars by the price of each car:\n\n12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays for all the cars, including the 10% tax and the $1,000 registration fee for each car. The question says \"Analipa ushuru wa 10% wa magari hayo na kisha $1000 ya usajili kwa kila moja yao\". Let's calculate the tax first:\n\n10% of $240,000 = $24,000 (10% of $240,000 is $24,000)\n\nNow, add the tax to the total amount:\n\n$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000\n\nFinally, add the $1,000 registration fee for each car:\n\n$264,000 + $12 x $1,000 = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000\n\nSo, the total amount of money the company pays for everything is $276,000.", "prediction": "276000"}
